Important

MySQL Enterprise Monitor will be end of life and deprecated with obsolescence as of January 1, 2025.

After this date, MySQL Enterprise Monitor will no longer receive security updates, non-security updates, bug fixes, or online technical content updates. It will transition to the *Sustaining Support model*.

What to expect when MySQL Enterprise Monitor reaches the end of life (EOL):

* MySQL will cease all bug fix activities for the product
* MySQL will cease all security fix activities for the product
* MySQL will cease all new feature work for the product

Sustaining Support does not include:

* New program updates, fixes, security alerts, and critical patch updates

* New tax, legal, or regulatory updates
* New upgrade scripts
* Certification with new third-party products/versions
* 24 hour commitment and response guidelines for Severity 1 service requests as defined in "Section 9 - Severity Definitions" in the document titled "Oracle Software Technical Support Policies"

* Previously released fixes or updates that Oracle has withdrawn from publication. Older or existing published software bundles will remain available as archived content.
