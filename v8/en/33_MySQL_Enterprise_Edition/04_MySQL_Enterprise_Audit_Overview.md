## 32.4 MySQL Enterprise Audit Overview

MySQL Enterprise Edition includes MySQL Enterprise Audit, implemented using a server plugin. MySQL Enterprise Audit uses the open MySQL Audit API to enable standard, policy-based monitoring and logging of connection and query activity executed on specific MySQL servers. Designed to meet the Oracle audit specification, MySQL Enterprise Audit provides an out of box, easy to use auditing and compliance solution for applications that are governed by both internal and external regulatory guidelines.

When installed, the audit plugin enables MySQL Server to produce a log file containing an audit record of server activity. The log contents include when clients connect and disconnect, and what actions they perform while connected, such as which databases and tables they access.

For more information, see Section 8.4.5, “MySQL Enterprise Audit”.
