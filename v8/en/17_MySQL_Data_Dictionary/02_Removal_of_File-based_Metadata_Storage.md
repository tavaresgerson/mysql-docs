## 16.2 Removal of File-based Metadata Storage

In previous MySQL releases, dictionary data was partially stored in metadata files. Issues with file-based metadata storage included expensive file scans, susceptibility to file system-related bugs, complex code for handling of replication and crash recovery failure states, and a lack of extensibility that made it difficult to add metadata for new features and relational objects.

The metadata files listed below are removed from MySQL. Unless otherwise noted, data previously stored in metadata files is now stored in data dictionary tables.

* `.frm` files: Table metadata files. With the removal of `.frm` files:

  + The 64KB table definition size limit imposed by the `.frm` file structure is removed.

  + The Information Schema `TABLES` table's `VERSION` column reports a hardcoded value of `10`, which is the last `.frm` file version used in MySQL 5.7.

* `.par` files: Partition definition files. `InnoDB` stopped using partition definition files in MySQL 5.7 with the introduction of native partitioning support for `InnoDB` tables.

* `.TRN` files: Trigger namespace files.
* `.TRG` files: Trigger parameter files.
* `.isl` files: `InnoDB` Symbolic Link files containing the location of file-per-table tablespace files created outside of the data directory.

* `db.opt` files: Database configuration files. These files, one per database directory, contained database default character set attributes.

* `ddl_log.log` file: The file contained records of metadata operations generated by data definition statements such as `DROP TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE`.
