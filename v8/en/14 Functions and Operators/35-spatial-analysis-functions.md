## 14.16 Spatial Analysis Functions

MySQL provides functions to perform various operations on spatial data. These functions can be grouped into several major categories according to the type of operation they perform:

* Functions that create geometries in various formats (WKT, WKB, internal)
* Functions that convert geometries between formats
* Functions that access qualitative or quantitative properties of a geometry
* Functions that describe relations between two geometries
* Functions that create new geometries from existing ones

For general background about MySQL support for using spatial data, see  Section 13.4, “Spatial Data Types”.
