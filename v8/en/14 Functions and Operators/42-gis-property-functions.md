### 14.16.7 Geometry Property Functions

Each function that belongs to this group takes a geometry value as its argument and returns some quantitative or qualitative property of the geometry. Some functions restrict their argument type. Such functions return `NULL` if the argument is of an incorrect geometry type. For example, the `ST_Area()` polygon function returns `NULL` if the object type is neither `Polygon` nor `MultiPolygon`.
