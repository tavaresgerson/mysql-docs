## 2.4 Installing MySQL on macOS

For a list of macOS versions that the MySQL server supports, see <https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/database.html>.

MySQL for macOS is available in a number of different forms:

* Native Package Installer, which uses the native macOS installer (DMG) to walk you through the installation of MySQL. For more information, see  Section 2.4.2, “Installing MySQL on macOS Using Native Packages”. You can use the package installer with macOS. The user you use to perform the installation must have administrator privileges.
* Compressed TAR archive, which uses a file packaged using the Unix `tar` and **gzip** commands. To use this method, you need to open a **Terminal** window. You do not need administrator privileges using this method; you can install the MySQL server anywhere using this method. For more information on using this method, you can use the generic instructions for using a tarball,  Section 2.2, “Installing MySQL on Unix/Linux Using Generic Binaries”.

  In addition to the core installation, the Package Installer also includes  Section 2.4.3, “Installing and Using the MySQL Launch Daemon” and Section 2.4.4, “Installing and Using the MySQL Preference Pane” to simplify the management of your installation.

For additional information on using MySQL on macOS, see Section 2.4.1, “General Notes on Installing MySQL on macOS”.
