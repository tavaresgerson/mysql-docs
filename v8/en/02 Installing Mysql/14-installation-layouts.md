### 2.1.5 Installation Layouts

The installation layout differs for different installation types (for example, native packages, binary tarballs, and source tarballs), which can lead to confusion when managing different systems or using different installation sources. The individual layouts are given in the corresponding installation type or platform chapter, as described following. Note that the layout of installations from vendors other than Oracle may differ from these layouts.

*  MySQL Installation Layout on Microsoft Windows
*  Section 2.8.3, “MySQL Layout for Source Installation”
*  Table 2.3, “MySQL Installation Layout for Generic Unix/Linux Binary Package”
*  Table 2.13, “MySQL Installation Layout for Linux RPM Packages from the MySQL Developer Zone”
*  Table 2.8, “MySQL Installation Layout on macOS”
