## 32.3 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Overview

MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a set of encryption functions based on the OpenSSL library that expose OpenSSL capabilities at the SQL level. These functions enable Enterprise applications to perform the following operations:

* Implement added data protection using public-key asymmetric cryptography
* Create public and private keys and digital signatures
* Perform asymmetric encryption and decryption
* Use cryptographic hashing for digital signing and data verification and validation
