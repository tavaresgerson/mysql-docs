This section indicates which character sets MySQL supports. There is one subsection for each group of related character sets. For each character set, the permissible collations are listed.

To list the available character sets and their default collations, use the  `SHOW CHARACTER SET` statement or query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` `CHARACTER_SETS` table. For example:

```

In cases where a character set has multiple collations, it might not be clear which collation is most suitable for a given application. To avoid choosing the wrong collation, it can be helpful to perform some comparisons with representative data values to make sure that a given collation sorts values the way you expect.
