### 15.1.2 ALTER DATABASE Statement

```
ALTER {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [db_name]
    alter_option ...

alter_option: {
    [DEFAULT] CHARACTER SET [=] charset_name
  | [DEFAULT] COLLATE [=] collation_name
  | [DEFAULT] ENCRYPTION [=] {'Y' | 'N'}
  | READ ONLY [=] {DEFAULT | 0 | 1}
}
```

`ALTER DATABASE` enables you to change the overall characteristics of a database. These characteristics are stored in the data dictionary. This statement requires the `ALTER` privilege on the database. `ALTER SCHEMA` is a synonym for `ALTER DATABASE`.

If the database name is omitted, the statement applies to the default database. In that case, an error occurs if there is no default database.

For any *`alter_option`* omitted from the statement, the database retains its current option value, with the exception that changing the character set may change the collation and vice versa.

* Character Set and Collation Options
* Encryption Option
* Read Only Option

#### Character Set and Collation Options

The `CHARACTER SET` option changes the default database character set. The `COLLATE` option changes the default database collation. For information about character set and collation names, see Chapter 12, *Character Sets, Collations, Unicode*.

To see the available character sets and collations, use the `SHOW CHARACTER SET` and `SHOW COLLATION` statements, respectively. See Section 15.7.7.3, “SHOW CHARACTER SET Statement”, and Section 15.7.7.4, “SHOW COLLATION Statement”.

A stored routine that uses the database defaults when the routine is created includes those defaults as part of its definition. (In a stored routine, variables with character data types use the database defaults if the character set or collation are not specified explicitly. See Section 15.1.17, “CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION Statements”.) If you change the default character set or collation for a database, any stored routines that are to use the new defaults must be dropped and recreated.

#### Encryption Option

The `ENCRYPTION` option, introduced in MySQL 8.0.16, defines the default database encryption, which is inherited by tables created in the database. The permitted values are `'Y'` (encryption enabled) and `'N'` (encryption disabled).

The `mysql` system schema cannot be set to default encryption. The existing tables within it are part of the general `mysql` tablespace, which may be encrypted. The `information_schema` contains only views. It is not possible to create any tables within it. There is nothing on the disk to encrypt. All tables in the `performance_schema` use the `PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA` engine, which is purely in-memory. It is not possible to create any other tables in it. There is nothing on the disk to encrypt.

Only newly created tables inherit the default database encryption. For existing tables associated with the database, their encryption remains unchanged. If the `table_encryption_privilege_check` system variable is enabled, the `TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN` privilege is required to specify a default encryption setting that differs from the value of the `default_table_encryption` system variable. For more information, see Defining an Encryption Default for Schemas and General Tablespaces.

#### Read Only Option

The `READ ONLY` option, introduced in MySQL 8.0.22, controls whether to permit modification of the database and objects within it. The permitted values are `DEFAULT` or `0` (not read only) and `1` (read only). This option is useful for database migration because a database for which `READ ONLY` is enabled can be migrated to another MySQL instance without concern that the database might be changed during the operation.

With NDB Cluster, making a database read only on one **mysqld** server is synchronized to other **mysqld** servers in the same cluster, so that the database becomes read only on all **mysqld** servers.

The `READ ONLY` option, if enabled, is displayed in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` `SCHEMATA_EXTENSIONS` table. See Section 28.3.32, “The INFORMATION_SCHEMA SCHEMATA_EXTENSIONS Table”.

The `READ ONLY` option cannot be enabled for these system schemas: `mysql`, `information_schema`, `performance_schema`.

In `ALTER DATABASE` statements, the `READ ONLY` option interacts with other instances of itself and with other options as follows:

* An error occurs if multiple instances of `READ ONLY` conflict (for example, `READ ONLY = 1 READ ONLY = 0`).

* An `ALTER DATABASE` statement that contains only (nonconflicting) `READ ONLY` options is permitted even for a read-only database.

* A mix of (nonconflicting) `READ ONLY` options with other options is permitted if the read-only state of the database either before or after the statement permits modifications. If the read-only state both before and after prohibits changes, an error occurs.

  This statement succeeds whether or not the database is read only:

  ```
  ALTER DATABASE mydb READ ONLY = 0 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
  ```

  This statement succeeds if the database is not read only, but fails if it is already read only:

  ```
  ALTER DATABASE mydb READ ONLY = 1 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
  ```

Enabling `READ ONLY` affects all users of the database, with these exceptions that are not subject to read-only checks:

* Statements executed by the server as part of server initialization, restart, upgrade, or replication.

* Statements in a file named at server startup by the `init_file` system variable.

* `TEMPORARY` tables; it is possible to create, alter, drop, and write to `TEMPORARY` tables in a read-only database.

* NDB Cluster non-SQL inserts and updates.

Other than for the excepted operations just listed, enabling `READ ONLY` prohibits write operations to the database and its objects, including their definitions, data, and metadata. The following list details affected SQL statements and operations:

* The database itself:

  + `CREATE DATABASE`
  + `ALTER DATABASE` (except to change the `READ ONLY` option)

  + `DROP DATABASE`
* Views:

  + `CREATE VIEW`
  + `ALTER VIEW`
  + `DROP VIEW`
  + Selecting from views that invoke functions with side effects.

  + Updating updatable views.
  + Statements that create or drop objects in a writable database are rejected if they affect metadata of a view in a read-only database (for example, by making the view valid or invalid).

* Stored routines:

  + `CREATE PROCEDURE`
  + `DROP PROCEDURE`
  + `CALL` (of procedures with side effects)

  + `CREATE FUNCTION`
  + `DROP FUNCTION`
  + `SELECT` (of functions with side effects)

  + For procedures and functions, read-only checks follow prelocking behavior. For `CALL` statements, read-only checks are done on a per-statement basis, so if some conditionally executed statement writing to a read-only database does not actually execute, the call still succeeds. On the other hand, for a function called within a `SELECT`, execution of the function body happens in prelocked mode. As long as a some statement within the function writes to a read-only database, execution of the function fails with an error regardless of whether the statement actually executes.

* Triggers:

  + `CREATE TRIGGER`
  + `DROP TRIGGER`
  + Trigger invocation.
* Events:

  + `CREATE EVENT`
  + `ALTER EVENT`
  + `DROP EVENT`
  + Event execution:

    - Executing an event in the database fails because that would change the last-execution timestamp, which is event metadata stored in the data dictionary. Failure of event execution also has the effect of causing the event scheduler to stop.

    - If an event writes to an object in a read-only database, execution of the event fails with an error, but the event scheduler is not stopped.

* Tables:

  + `CREATE TABLE`
  + `ALTER TABLE`
  + `CREATE INDEX`
  + `DROP INDEX`
  + `RENAME TABLE`
  + `TRUNCATE TABLE`
  + `DROP TABLE`
  + `DELETE`
  + `INSERT`
  + `IMPORT TABLE`
  + `LOAD DATA`
  + `LOAD XML`
  + `REPLACE`
  + `UPDATE`
  + For cascading foreign keys where the child table is in a read-only database, updates and deletes on the parent are rejected even if the child table is not directly affected.

  + For a `MERGE` table such as `CREATE TABLE s1.t(i int) ENGINE MERGE UNION (s2.t, s3.t), INSERT_METHOD=...`, the following behavior applies:

    - Inserting into the `MERGE` table (`INSERT into s1.t`) fails if at least one of `s1`, `s2`, `s3` is read only, regardless of insert method. The insert is refused even if it would actually end up in a writable table.

    - Dropping the `MERGE` table (`DROP TABLE s1.t`) succeeds as long as `s1` is not read only. It is permitted to drop a `MERGE` table that refers to a read-only database.

An `ALTER DATABASE` statement blocks until all concurrent transactions that have already accessed an object in the database being altered have committed. Conversely, a write transaction accessing an object in a database being altered in a concurrent `ALTER DATABASE` blocks until the `ALTER DATABASE` has committed.

If the Clone plugin is used to clone a local or remote data directory, the databases in the clone retain the read-only state they had in the source data directory. The read-only state does not affect the cloning process itself. If it is not desirable to have the same database read-only state in the clone, the option must be changed explicitly for the clone after the cloning process has finished, using `ALTER DATABASE` operations on the clone.

When cloning from a donor to a recipient, if the recipient has a user database that is read only, cloning fails with an error message. Cloning may be retried after making the database writable.

`READ ONLY` is permitted for `ALTER DATABASE`, but not for `CREATE DATABASE`. However, for a read-only database, the statement produced by `SHOW CREATE DATABASE` does include `READ ONLY=1` within a comment to indicate its read-only status:

```
mysql> ALTER DATABASE mydb READ ONLY = 1;
mysql> SHOW CREATE DATABASE mydb\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Database: mydb
Create Database: CREATE DATABASE `mydb`
                 /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
                          COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci */
                 /*!80016 DEFAULT ENCRYPTION='N' */
                 /* READ ONLY = 1 */
```

If the server executes a `CREATE DATABASE` statement containing such a comment, the server ignores the comment and the `READ ONLY` option is not processed. This has implications for **mysqldump** and **mysqlpump**, which use `SHOW CREATE DATABASE` to produce `CREATE DATABASE` statements in dump output:

* In a dump file, the `CREATE DATABASE` statement for a read-only database contains the commented `READ ONLY` option.

* The dump file can be restored as usual, but because the server ignores the commented `READ ONLY` option, the restored database is *not* read only. If the database is to be read only after being restored, you must execute `ALTER DATABASE` manually to make it so.

Suppose that `mydb` is read only and you dump it as follows:

```
$> mysqldump --databases mydb > mydb.sql
```

A restore operation later must be followed by `ALTER DATABASE` if `mydb` should still be read only:

```
$> mysql
mysql> SOURCE mydb.sql;
mysql> ALTER DATABASE mydb READ ONLY = 1;
```

MySQL Enterprise Backup is not subject to this issue. It backs up and restores a read-only database like any other, but enables the `READ ONLY` option at restore time if it was enabled at backup time.

`ALTER DATABASE` is written to the binary log, so a change to the `READ ONLY` option on a replication source server also affects replicas. To prevent this from happening, binary logging must be disabled prior to execution of the `ALTER DATABASE` statement. For example, to prepare for migrating a database without affecting replicas, perform these operations:

1. Within a single session, disable binary logging and enable `READ ONLY` for the database:

   ```
   mysql> SET sql_log_bin = OFF;
   mysql> ALTER DATABASE mydb READ ONLY = 1;
   ```

2. Dump the database, for example, with **mysqldump** or **mysqlpump**:

   ```
   $> mysqldump --databases mydb > mydb.sql
   ```

3. Within a single session, disable binary logging and disable `READ ONLY` for the database:

   ```
   mysql> SET sql_log_bin = OFF;
   mysql> ALTER DATABASE mydb READ ONLY = 0;
   ```
