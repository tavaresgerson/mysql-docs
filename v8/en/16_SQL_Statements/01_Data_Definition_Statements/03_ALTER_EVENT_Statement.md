### 15.1.3 ALTER EVENT Statement

```
ALTER
    [DEFINER = user]
    EVENT event_name
    [ON SCHEDULE schedule]
    [ON COMPLETION [NOT] PRESERVE]
    [RENAME TO new_event_name]
    [ENABLE | DISABLE | DISABLE ON SLAVE]
    [COMMENT 'string']
    [DO event_body]
```

The `ALTER EVENT` statement changes one or more of the characteristics of an existing event without the need to drop and recreate it. The syntax for each of the `DEFINER`, `ON SCHEDULE`, `ON COMPLETION`, `COMMENT`, `ENABLE` / `DISABLE`, and `DO` clauses is exactly the same as when used with `CREATE EVENT`. (See Section 15.1.13, “CREATE EVENT Statement”.)

Any user can alter an event defined on a database for which that user has the `EVENT` privilege. When a user executes a successful `ALTER EVENT` statement, that user becomes the definer for the affected event.

`ALTER EVENT` works only with an existing event:

```
mysql> ALTER EVENT no_such_event
     >     ON SCHEDULE
     >       EVERY '2:3' DAY_HOUR;
ERROR 1517 (HY000): Unknown event 'no_such_event'
```

In each of the following examples, assume that the event named `myevent` is defined as shown here:

```
CREATE EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE
      EVERY 6 HOUR
    COMMENT 'A sample comment.'
    DO
      UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;
```

The following statement changes the schedule for `myevent` from once every six hours starting immediately to once every twelve hours, starting four hours from the time the statement is run:

```
ALTER EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE
      EVERY 12 HOUR
    STARTS CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 4 HOUR;
```

It is possible to change multiple characteristics of an event in a single statement. This example changes the SQL statement executed by `myevent` to one that deletes all records from `mytable`; it also changes the schedule for the event such that it executes once, one day after this `ALTER EVENT` statement is run.

```
ALTER EVENT myevent
    ON SCHEDULE
      AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 DAY
    DO
      TRUNCATE TABLE myschema.mytable;
```

Specify the options in an `ALTER EVENT` statement only for those characteristics that you want to change; omitted options keep their existing values. This includes any default values for `CREATE EVENT` such as `ENABLE`.

To disable `myevent`, use this `ALTER EVENT` statement:

```
ALTER EVENT myevent
    DISABLE;
```

The `ON SCHEDULE` clause may use expressions involving built-in MySQL functions and user variables to obtain any of the *`timestamp`* or *`interval`* values which it contains. You cannot use stored routines or loadable functions in such expressions, and you cannot use any table references; however, you can use `SELECT FROM DUAL`. This is true for both `ALTER EVENT` and `CREATE EVENT` statements. References to stored routines, loadable functions, and tables in such cases are specifically not permitted, and fail with an error (see Bug
#22830).

Although an `ALTER EVENT` statement that contains another `ALTER EVENT` statement in its `DO` clause appears to succeed, when the server attempts to execute the resulting scheduled event, the execution fails with an error.

To rename an event, use the `ALTER EVENT` statement's `RENAME TO` clause. This statement renames the event `myevent` to `yourevent`:

```
ALTER EVENT myevent
    RENAME TO yourevent;
```

You can also move an event to a different database using `ALTER EVENT ... RENAME TO ...` and `db_name.event_name` notation, as shown here:

```
ALTER EVENT olddb.myevent
    RENAME TO newdb.myevent;
```

To execute the previous statement, the user executing it must have the `EVENT` privilege on both the `olddb` and `newdb` databases.

Note

There is no `RENAME EVENT` statement.

The value `DISABLE ON SLAVE` is used on a replica instead of `ENABLE` or `DISABLE` to indicate an event that was created on the replication source server and replicated to the replica, but that is not executed on the replica. Normally, `DISABLE ON SLAVE` is set automatically as required; however, there are some circumstances under which you may want or need to change it manually. See Section 19.5.1.16, “Replication of Invoked Features”, for more information.
