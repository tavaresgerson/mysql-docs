### 15.1.31 DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM Statement

```
DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM
    [IF EXISTS]
    srid

srid: 32-bit unsigned integer
```

This statement removes a spatial reference system (SRS) definition from the data dictionary. It requires the `SUPER` privilege.

Example:

```
DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM 4120;
```

If no SRS definition with the SRID value exists, an error occurs unless `IF EXISTS` is specified. In that case, a warning occurs rather than an error.

If the SRID value is used by some column in an existing table, an error occurs. For example:

```
mysql> DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM 4326;
ERROR 3716 (SR005): Can't modify SRID 4326. There is at
least one column depending on it.
```

To identify which column or columns use the SRID, use this query:

```
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ST_GEOMETRY_COLUMNS WHERE SRS_ID=4326;
```

SRID values must be in the range of 32-bit unsigned integers, with these restrictions:

* SRID 0 is a valid SRID but cannot be used with `DROP SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM`.

* If the value is in a reserved SRID range, a warning occurs. Reserved ranges are [0, 32767] (reserved by EPSG), [60,000,000, 69,999,999] (reserved by EPSG), and [2,000,000,000, 2,147,483,647] (reserved by MySQL). EPSG stands for the European Petroleum Survey Group.

* Users should not drop SRSs with SRIDs in the reserved ranges. If system-installed SRSs are dropped, the SRS definitions may be recreated for MySQL upgrades.
