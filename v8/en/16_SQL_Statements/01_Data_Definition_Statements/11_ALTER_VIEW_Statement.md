### 15.1.11 ALTER VIEW Statement

```
ALTER
    [ALGORITHM = {UNDEFINED | MERGE | TEMPTABLE}]
    [DEFINER = user]
    [SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }]
    VIEW view_name [(column_list)]
    AS select_statement
    [WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION]
```

This statement changes the definition of a view, which must exist. The syntax is similar to that for `CREATE VIEW` see Section 15.1.23, “CREATE VIEW Statement”). This statement requires the `CREATE VIEW` and `DROP` privileges for the view, and some privilege for each column referred to in the `SELECT` statement. `ALTER VIEW` is permitted only to the definer or users with the `SET_USER_ID` privilege (or the deprecated `SUPER` privilege).
