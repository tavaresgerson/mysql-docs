### 15.1.33 DROP TABLESPACE Statement

```
DROP [UNDO] TABLESPACE tablespace_name
    [ENGINE [=] engine_name]
```

This statement drops a tablespace that was previously created using `CREATE TABLESPACE`. It is supported by the `NDB` and `InnoDB` storage engines.

The `UNDO` keyword, introduced in MySQL 8.0.14, must be specified to drop an undo tablespace. Only undo tablespaces created using `CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE` syntax can be dropped. An undo tablespace must be in an `empty` state before it can be dropped. For more information, see Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”.

`ENGINE` sets the storage engine that uses the tablespace, where *`engine_name`* is the name of the storage engine. Currently, the values `InnoDB` and `NDB` are supported. If not set, the value of `default_storage_engine` is used. If it is not the same as the storage engine used to create the tablespace, the `DROP TABLESPACE` statement fails.

`tablespace_name` is a case-sensitive identifier in MySQL.

For an `InnoDB` general tablespace, all tables must be dropped from the tablespace prior to a `DROP TABLESPACE` operation. If the tablespace is not empty, `DROP TABLESPACE` returns an error.

An `NDB` tablespace to be dropped must not contain any data files; in other words, before you can drop an `NDB` tablespace, you must first drop each of its data files using `ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP DATAFILE`.

#### Notes

* A general `InnoDB` tablespace is not deleted automatically when the last table in the tablespace is dropped. The tablespace must be dropped explicitly using `DROP TABLESPACE tablespace_name`.

* A `DROP DATABASE` operation can drop tables that belong to a general tablespace but it cannot drop the tablespace, even if the operation drops all tables that belong to the tablespace. The tablespace must be dropped explicitly using `DROP TABLESPACE tablespace_name`.

* Similar to the system tablespace, truncating or dropping tables stored in a general tablespace creates free space internally in the general tablespace .ibd data file which can only be used for new `InnoDB` data. Space is not released back to the operating system as it is for file-per-table tablespaces.

#### InnoDB Examples

This example demonstrates how to drop an `InnoDB` general tablespace. The general tablespace `ts1` is created with a single table. Before dropping the tablespace, the table must be dropped.

```
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts1` ADD DATAFILE 'ts1.ibd' Engine=InnoDB;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 Engine=InnoDB;

mysql> DROP TABLE t1;

mysql> DROP TABLESPACE ts1;
```

This example demonstrates dropping an undo tablespace. An undo tablespace must be in an `empty` state before it can be dropped. For more information, see Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”.

```
mysql> DROP UNDO TABLESPACE undo_003;
```

#### NDB Example

This example shows how to drop an `NDB` tablespace `myts` having a data file named `mydata-1.dat` after first creating the tablespace, and assumes the existence of a log file group named `mylg` (see Section 15.1.16, “CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement”).

```
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE myts
    ->     ADD DATAFILE 'mydata-1.dat'
    ->     USE LOGFILE GROUP mylg
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
```

You must remove all data files from the tablespace using `ALTER TABLESPACE`, as shown here, before it can be dropped:

```
mysql> ALTER TABLESPACE myts
    ->     DROP DATAFILE 'mydata-1.dat'
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;

mysql> DROP TABLESPACE myts;
```
