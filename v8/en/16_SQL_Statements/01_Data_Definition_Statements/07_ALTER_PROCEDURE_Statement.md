### 15.1.7 ALTER PROCEDURE Statement

```
ALTER PROCEDURE proc_name [characteristic ...]

characteristic: {
    COMMENT 'string'
  | LANGUAGE SQL
  | { CONTAINS SQL | NO SQL | READS SQL DATA | MODIFIES SQL DATA }
  | SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }
}
```

This statement can be used to change the characteristics of a stored procedure. More than one change may be specified in an `ALTER PROCEDURE` statement. However, you cannot change the parameters or body of a stored procedure using this statement; to make such changes, you must drop and re-create the procedure using `DROP PROCEDURE` and `CREATE PROCEDURE`.

You must have the `ALTER ROUTINE` privilege for the procedure. By default, that privilege is granted automatically to the procedure creator. This behavior can be changed by disabling the `automatic_sp_privileges` system variable. See Section 27.2.2, “Stored Routines and MySQL Privileges”.
