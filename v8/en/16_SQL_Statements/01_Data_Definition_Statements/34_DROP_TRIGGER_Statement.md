### 15.1.34 DROP TRIGGER Statement

```
DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] [schema_name.]trigger_name
```

This statement drops a trigger. The schema (database) name is optional. If the schema is omitted, the trigger is dropped from the default schema. `DROP TRIGGER` requires the `TRIGGER` privilege for the table associated with the trigger.

Use `IF EXISTS` to prevent an error from occurring for a trigger that does not exist. A `NOTE` is generated for a nonexistent trigger when using `IF EXISTS`. See Section 15.7.7.42, “SHOW WARNINGS Statement”.

Triggers for a table are also dropped if you drop the table.
