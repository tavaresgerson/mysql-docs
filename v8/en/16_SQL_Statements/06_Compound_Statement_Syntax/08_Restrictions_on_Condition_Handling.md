### 15.6.8 Restrictions on Condition Handling

`SIGNAL`, `RESIGNAL`, and `GET DIAGNOSTICS` are not permissible as prepared statements. For example, this statement is invalid:

```
PREPARE stmt1 FROM 'SIGNAL SQLSTATE "02000"';
```

`SQLSTATE` values in class `'04'` are not treated specially. They are handled the same as other exceptions.

In standard SQL, the first condition relates to the `SQLSTATE` value returned for the previous SQL statement. In MySQL, this is not guaranteed, so to get the main error, you cannot do this:

```
GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1 @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;
```

Instead, do this:

```
GET DIAGNOSTICS @cno = NUMBER;
GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION @cno @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;
```
