#### 15.6.5.8 WHILE Statement

```
[begin_label:] WHILE search_condition DO
    statement_list
END WHILE [end_label]
```

The statement list within a `WHILE` statement is repeated as long as the *`search_condition`* expression is true. *`statement_list`* consists of one or more SQL statements, each terminated by a semicolon (`;`) statement delimiter.

A `WHILE` statement can be labeled. For the rules regarding label use, see Section 15.6.2, “Statement Labels”.

Example:

```
CREATE PROCEDURE dowhile()
BEGIN
  DECLARE v1 INT DEFAULT 5;

  WHILE v1 > 0 DO
    ...
    SET v1 = v1 - 1;
  END WHILE;
END;
```
