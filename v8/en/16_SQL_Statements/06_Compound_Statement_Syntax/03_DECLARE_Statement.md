### 15.6.3 DECLARE Statement

The `DECLARE` statement is used to define various items local to a program:

* Local variables. See Section 15.6.4, “Variables in Stored Programs”.

* Conditions and handlers. See Section 15.6.7, “Condition Handling”.

* Cursors. See Section 15.6.6, “Cursors”.

`DECLARE` is permitted only inside a `BEGIN ... END` compound statement and must be at its start, before any other statements.

Declarations must follow a certain order. Cursor declarations must appear before handler declarations. Variable and condition declarations must appear before cursor or handler declarations.
