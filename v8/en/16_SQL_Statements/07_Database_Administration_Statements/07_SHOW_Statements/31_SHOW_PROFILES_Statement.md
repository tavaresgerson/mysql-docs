#### 15.7.7.31 SHOW PROFILES Statement

```
SHOW PROFILES
```

The `SHOW PROFILES` statement, together with `SHOW PROFILE`, displays profiling information that indicates resource usage for statements executed during the course of the current session. For more information, see Section 15.7.7.30, “SHOW PROFILE Statement”.

Note

The `SHOW PROFILE` and `SHOW PROFILES` statements are deprecated; expect it to be removed in a future MySQL release. Use the Performance Schema instead; see Section 29.19.1, “Query Profiling Using Performance Schema”.
