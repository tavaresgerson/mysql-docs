#### 15.7.8.1 BINLOG Statement

```
BINLOG 'str'
```

`BINLOG` is an internal-use statement. It is generated by the **mysqlbinlog** program as the printable representation of certain events in binary log files. (See Section 6.6.9, “mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files”.) The `'str'` value is a base 64-encoded string the that server decodes to determine the data change indicated by the corresponding event.

To execute `BINLOG` statements when applying **mysqlbinlog** output, a user account requires the `BINLOG_ADMIN` privilege (or the deprecated `SUPER` privilege), or the `REPLICATION_APPLIER` privilege plus the appropriate privileges to execute each log event.

This statement can execute only format description events and row events.
