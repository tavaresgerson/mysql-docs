### 15.2.6 IMPORT TABLE Statement

```
IMPORT TABLE FROM sdi_file [, sdi_file] ...
```

The `IMPORT TABLE` statement imports `MyISAM` tables based on information contained in `.sdi` (serialized dictionary information) metadata files. `IMPORT TABLE` requires the `FILE` privilege to read the `.sdi` and table content files, and the `CREATE` privilege for the table to be created.

Tables can be exported from one server using **mysqldump** to write a file of SQL statements and imported into another server using **mysql** to process the dump file. `IMPORT TABLE` provides a faster alternative using the “raw” table files.

Prior to import, the files that provide the table content must be placed in the appropriate schema directory for the import server, and the `.sdi` file must be located in a directory accessible to the server. For example, the `.sdi` file can be placed in the directory named by the `secure_file_priv` system variable, or (if `secure_file_priv` is empty) in a directory under the server data directory.

The following example describes how to export `MyISAM` tables named `employees` and `managers` from the `hr` schema of one server and import them into the `hr` schema of another server. The example uses these assumptions (to perform a similar operation on your own system, modify the path names as appropriate):

* For the export server, *`export_basedir`* represents its base directory, and its data directory is `export_basedir/data`.

* For the import server, *`import_basedir`* represents its base directory, and its data directory is `import_basedir/data`.

* Table files are exported from the export server into the `/tmp/export` directory and this directory is secure (not accessible to other users).

* The import server uses `/tmp/mysql-files` as the directory named by its `secure_file_priv` system variable.

To export tables from the export server, use this procedure:

1. Ensure a consistent snapshot by executing this statement to lock the tables so that they cannot be modified during export:

   ```
   mysql> FLUSH TABLES hr.employees, hr.managers WITH READ LOCK;
   ```

   While the lock is in effect, the tables can still be used, but only for read access.

2. At the file system level, copy the `.sdi` and table content files from the `hr` schema directory to the secure export directory:

   * The `.sdi` file is located in the `hr` schema directory, but might not have exactly the same basename as the table name. For example, the `.sdi` files for the `employees` and `managers` tables might be named `employees_125.sdi` and `managers_238.sdi`.

   * For a `MyISAM` table, the content files are its `.MYD` data file and `.MYI` index file.

   Given those file names, the copy commands look like this:

   ```
   $> cd export_basedir/data/hr
   $> cp employees_125.sdi /tmp/export
   $> cp managers_238.sdi /tmp/export
   $> cp employees.{MYD,MYI} /tmp/export
   $> cp managers.{MYD,MYI} /tmp/export
   ```

3. Unlock the tables:

   ```
   mysql> UNLOCK TABLES;
   ```

To import tables into the import server, use this procedure:

1. The import schema must exist. If necessary, execute this statement to create it:

   ```
   mysql> CREATE SCHEMA hr;
   ```

2. At the file system level, copy the `.sdi` files to the import server `secure_file_priv` directory, `/tmp/mysql-files`. Also, copy the table content files to the `hr` schema directory:

   ```
   $> cd /tmp/export
   $> cp employees_125.sdi /tmp/mysql-files
   $> cp managers_238.sdi /tmp/mysql-files
   $> cp employees.{MYD,MYI} import_basedir/data/hr
   $> cp managers.{MYD,MYI} import_basedir/data/hr
   ```

3. Import the tables by executing an `IMPORT TABLE` statement that names the `.sdi` files:

   ```
   mysql> IMPORT TABLE FROM
          '/tmp/mysql-files/employees.sdi',
          '/tmp/mysql-files/managers.sdi';
   ```

The `.sdi` file need not be placed in the import server directory named by the `secure_file_priv` system variable if that variable is empty; it can be in any directory accessible to the server, including the schema directory for the imported table. If the `.sdi` file is placed in that directory, however, it may be rewritten; the import operation creates a new `.sdi` file for the table, which overwrites the old `.sdi` file if the operation uses the same file name for the new file.

Each *`sdi_file`* value must be a string literal that names the `.sdi` file for a table or is a pattern that matches `.sdi` files. If the string is a pattern, any leading directory path and the `.sdi` file name suffix must be given literally. Pattern characters are permitted only in the base name part of the file name:

* `?` matches any single character
* `*` matches any sequence of characters, including no characters

Using a pattern, the previous `IMPORT TABLE` statement could have been written like this (assuming that the `/tmp/mysql-files` directory contains no other `.sdi` files matching the pattern):

```
IMPORT TABLE FROM '/tmp/mysql-files/*.sdi';
```

To interpret the location of `.sdi` file path names, the server uses the same rules for `IMPORT TABLE` as the server-side rules for `LOAD DATA` (that is, the non-`LOCAL` rules). See Section 15.2.9, “LOAD DATA Statement”, paying particular attention to the rules used to interpret relative path names.

`IMPORT TABLE` fails if the `.sdi` or table files cannot be located. After importing a table, the server attempts to open it and reports as warnings any problems detected. To attempt a repair to correct any reported issues, use `REPAIR TABLE`.

`IMPORT TABLE` is not written to the binary log.

#### Restrictions and Limitations

`IMPORT TABLE` applies only to non-`TEMPORARY` `MyISAM` tables. It does not apply to tables created with a transactional storage engine, tables created with `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE`, or views.

An `.sdi` file used in an import operation must be generated on a server with the same data dictionary version and sdi version as the import server. The version information of the generating server is found in the `.sdi` file:

```
{
   "mysqld_version_id":80019,
   "dd_version":80017,
   "sdi_version":80016,
   ...
}
```

To determine the data dictionary and sdi version of the import server, you can check the `.sdi` file of a recently created table on the import server.

The table data and index files must be placed in the schema directory for the import server prior to the import operation, unless the table as defined on the export server uses the `DATA DIRECTORY` or `INDEX DIRECTORY` table options. In that case, modify the import procedure using one of these alternatives before executing the `IMPORT TABLE` statement:

* Put the data and index files into the same directory on the import server host as on the export server host, and create symlinks in the import server schema directory to those files.

* Put the data and index files into an import server host directory different from that on the export server host, and create symlinks in the import server schema directory to those files. In addition, modify the `.sdi` file to reflect the different file locations.

* Put the data and index files into the schema directory on the import server host, and modify the `.sdi` file to remove the data and index directory table options.

Any collation IDs stored in the `.sdi` file must refer to the same collations on the export and import servers.

Trigger information for a table is not serialized into the table `.sdi` file, so triggers are not restored by the import operation.

Some edits to an `.sdi` file are permissible prior to executing the `IMPORT TABLE` statement, whereas others are problematic or may even cause the import operation to fail:

* Changing the data directory and index directory table options is required if the locations of the data and index files differ between the export and import servers.

* Changing the schema name is required to import the table into a different schema on the import server than on the export server.

* Changing schema and table names may be required to accommodate differences between file system case-sensitivity semantics on the export and import servers or differences in `lower_case_table_names` settings. Changing the table names in the `.sdi` file may require renaming the table files as well.

* In some cases, changes to column definitions are permitted. Changing data types is likely to cause problems.
