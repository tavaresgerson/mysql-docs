### 15.5.3 DEALLOCATE PREPARE Statement

```
{DEALLOCATE | DROP} PREPARE stmt_name
```

To deallocate a prepared statement produced with `PREPARE`, use a `DEALLOCATE PREPARE` statement that refers to the prepared statement name. Attempting to execute a prepared statement after deallocating it results in an error. If too many prepared statements are created and not deallocated by either the `DEALLOCATE PREPARE` statement or the end of the session, you might encounter the upper limit enforced by the `max_prepared_stmt_count` system variable.

For examples, see Section 15.5, “Prepared Statements”.
