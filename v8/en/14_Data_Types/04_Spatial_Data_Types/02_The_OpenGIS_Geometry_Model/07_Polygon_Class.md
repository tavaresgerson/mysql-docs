#### 13.4.2.7 Polygon Class

A `Polygon` is a planar `Surface` representing a multisided geometry. It is defined by a single exterior boundary and zero or more interior boundaries, where each interior boundary defines a hole in the `Polygon`.

**`Polygon` Examples**

* On a region map, `Polygon` objects could represent forests, districts, and so on.

**`Polygon` Assertions**

* The boundary of a `Polygon` consists of a set of `LinearRing` objects (that is, `LineString` objects that are both simple and closed) that make up its exterior and interior boundaries.

* A `Polygon` has no rings that cross. The rings in the boundary of a `Polygon` may intersect at a `Point`, but only as a tangent.

* A `Polygon` has no lines, spikes, or punctures.

* A `Polygon` has an interior that is a connected point set.

* A `Polygon` may have holes. The exterior of a `Polygon` with holes is not connected. Each hole defines a connected component of the exterior.

The preceding assertions make a `Polygon` a simple geometry.
