### 14.9.2 Boolean Full-Text Searches

MySQL can perform boolean full-text searches using the `IN BOOLEAN MODE` modifier. With this modifier, certain characters have special meaning at the beginning or end of words in the search string. In the following query, the `+` and `-` operators indicate that a word must be present or absent, respectively, for a match to occur. Thus, the query retrieves all the rows that contain the word “MySQL” but that do *not* contain the word “YourSQL”:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('+MySQL -YourSQL' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
+----+-----------------------+-------------------------------------+
| id | title                 | body                                |

Note

In implementing this feature, MySQL uses what is sometimes referred to as implied Boolean logic, in which

* `+` stands for `AND`
* `-` stands for `NOT`
* [*no operator*] implies `OR`

Boolean full-text searches have these characteristics:

* They do not automatically sort rows in order of decreasing relevance.

* `InnoDB` tables require a `FULLTEXT` index on all columns of the `MATCH()` expression to perform boolean queries. Boolean queries against a `MyISAM` search index can work even without a `FULLTEXT` index, although a search executed in this fashion would be quite slow.

* The minimum and maximum word length full-text parameters apply to `FULLTEXT` indexes created using the built-in `FULLTEXT` parser and MeCab parser plugin. `innodb_ft_min_token_size` and `innodb_ft_max_token_size` are used for `InnoDB` search indexes. `ft_min_word_len` and `ft_max_word_len` are used for `MyISAM` search indexes.

  Minimum and maximum word length full-text parameters do not apply to `FULLTEXT` indexes created using the ngram parser. ngram token size is defined by the `ngram_token_size` option.

* The stopword list applies, controlled by `innodb_ft_enable_stopword`, `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`, and `innodb_ft_user_stopword_table` for `InnoDB` search indexes, and `ft_stopword_file` for `MyISAM` ones.

* `InnoDB` full-text search does not support the use of multiple operators on a single search word, as in this example: `'++apple'`. Use of multiple operators on a single search word returns a syntax error to standard out. MyISAM full-text search successfully processes the same search, ignoring all operators except for the operator immediately adjacent to the search word.

* `InnoDB` full-text search only supports leading plus or minus signs. For example, `InnoDB` supports `'+apple'` but does not support `'apple+'`. Specifying a trailing plus or minus sign causes `InnoDB` to report a syntax error.

* `InnoDB` full-text search does not support the use of a leading plus sign with wildcard (`'+*'`), a plus and minus sign combination (`'+-'`), or leading a plus and minus sign combination (`'+-apple'`). These invalid queries return a syntax error.

* `InnoDB` full-text search does not support the use of the `@` symbol in boolean full-text searches. The `@` symbol is reserved for use by the `@distance` proximity search operator.

* They do not use the 50% threshold that applies to `MyISAM` search indexes.

The boolean full-text search capability supports the following operators:

* `+`

  A leading or trailing plus sign indicates that this word *must* be present in each row that is returned. `InnoDB` only supports leading plus signs.

* `-`

  A leading or trailing minus sign indicates that this word must *not* be present in any of the rows that are returned. `InnoDB` only supports leading minus signs.

  Note: The `-` operator acts only to exclude rows that are otherwise matched by other search terms. Thus, a boolean-mode search that contains only terms preceded by `-` returns an empty result. It does not return “all rows except those containing any of the excluded terms.”

* (no operator)

  By default (when neither `+` nor `-` is specified), the word is optional, but the rows that contain it are rated higher. This mimics the behavior of `MATCH() AGAINST()` without the `IN BOOLEAN MODE` modifier.

* `@distance`

  This operator works on `InnoDB` tables only. It tests whether two or more words all start within a specified distance from each other, measured in words. Specify the search words within a double-quoted string immediately before the `@distance` operator, for example, `MATCH(col1) AGAINST('"word1 word2 word3" @8' IN BOOLEAN MODE)`

* `> <`

  These two operators are used to change a word's contribution to the relevance value that is assigned to a row. The `>` operator increases the contribution and the `<` operator decreases it. See the example following this list.

* `( )`

  Parentheses group words into subexpressions. Parenthesized groups can be nested.

* `~`

  A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's contribution to the row's relevance to be negative. This is useful for marking “noise” words. A row containing such a word is rated lower than others, but is not excluded altogether, as it would be with the `-` operator.

* `*`

  The asterisk serves as the truncation (or wildcard) operator. Unlike the other operators, it is *appended* to the word to be affected. Words match if they begin with the word preceding the `*` operator.

  If a word is specified with the truncation operator, it is not stripped from a boolean query, even if it is too short or a stopword. Whether a word is too short is determined from the `innodb_ft_min_token_size` setting for `InnoDB` tables, or `ft_min_word_len` for `MyISAM` tables. These options are not applicable to `FULLTEXT` indexes that use the ngram parser.

  The wildcarded word is considered as a prefix that must be present at the start of one or more words. If the minimum word length is 4, a search for `'+word +the*'` could return fewer rows than a search for `'+word +the'`, because the second query ignores the too-short search term `the`.

* `"`

  A phrase that is enclosed within double quote (`"`) characters matches only rows that contain the phrase *literally, as it was typed*. The full-text engine splits the phrase into words and performs a search in the `FULLTEXT` index for the words. Nonword characters need not be matched exactly: Phrase searching requires only that matches contain exactly the same words as the phrase and in the same order. For example, `"test phrase"` matches `"test, phrase"`.

  If the phrase contains no words that are in the index, the result is empty. The words might not be in the index because of a combination of factors: if they do not exist in the text, are stopwords, or are shorter than the minimum length of indexed words.

The following examples demonstrate some search strings that use boolean full-text operators:

* `'apple banana'`

  Find rows that contain at least one of the two words.

* `'+apple +juice'`

  Find rows that contain both words.

* `'+apple macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple”, but rank rows higher if they also contain “macintosh”.

* `'+apple -macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple” but not “macintosh”.

* `'+apple ~macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple”, but if the row also contains the word “macintosh”, rate it lower than if row does not. This is “softer” than a search for `'+apple -macintosh'`, for which the presence of “macintosh” causes the row not to be returned at all.

* `'+apple +(>turnover <strudel)'`

  Find rows that contain the words “apple” and “turnover”, or “apple” and “strudel” (in any order), but rank “apple turnover” higher than “apple strudel”.

* `'apple*'`

  Find rows that contain words such as “apple”, “apples”, “applesauce”, or “applet”.

* `'"some words"'`

  Find rows that contain the exact phrase “some words” (for example, rows that contain “some words of wisdom” but not “some noise words”). Note that the `"` characters that enclose the phrase are operator characters that delimit the phrase. They are not the quotation marks that enclose the search string itself.

#### Relevancy Rankings for InnoDB Boolean Mode Search

`InnoDB` full-text search is modeled on the Sphinx full-text search engine, and the algorithms used are based on BM25 and TF-IDF ranking algorithms. For these reasons, relevancy rankings for `InnoDB` boolean full-text search may differ from `MyISAM` relevancy rankings.

`InnoDB` uses a variation of the “term frequency-inverse document frequency” (`TF-IDF`) weighting system to rank a document's relevance for a given full-text search query. The `TF-IDF` weighting is based on how frequently a word appears in a document, offset by how frequently the word appears in all documents in the collection. In other words, the more frequently a word appears in a document, and the less frequently the word appears in the document collection, the higher the document is ranked.

##### How Relevancy Ranking is Calculated

The term frequency (`TF`) value is the number of times that a word appears in a document. The inverse document frequency (`IDF`) value of a word is calculated using the following formula, where `total_records` is the number of records in the collection, and `matching_records` is the number of records that the search term appears in.

```
${IDF} = log10( ${total_records} / ${matching_records} )
```

When a document contains a word multiple times, the IDF value is multiplied by the TF value:

```
${TF} * ${IDF}
```

Using the `TF` and `IDF` values, the relevancy ranking for a document is calculated using this formula:

```
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

The formula is demonstrated in the following examples.

##### Relevancy Ranking for a Single Word Search

This example demonstrates the relevancy ranking calculation for a single-word search.

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE articles (
    ->   id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ->   title VARCHAR(200),
    ->   body TEXT,
    ->   FULLTEXT (title,body)
    ->)  ENGINE=InnoDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.04 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO articles (title,body) VALUES
    ->   ('MySQL Tutorial','This database tutorial ...'),
    ->   ("How To Use MySQL",'After you went through a ...'),
    ->   ('Optimizing Your Database','In this database tutorial ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL vs. YourSQL','When comparing databases ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL Security','When configured properly, MySQL ...'),
    ->   ('Database, Database, Database','database database database'),
    ->   ('1001 MySQL Tricks','1. Never run mysqld as root. 2. ...'),

mysql> SELECT id, title, body,

    ->   FROM articles ORDER BY score DESC;
+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+---------------------+
| id | title                        | body                                | score               |

8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

There are 8 records in total, with 3 that match the “database” search term. The first record (`id 6`) contains the search term 6 times and has a relevancy ranking of `1.0886961221694946`. This ranking value is calculated using a `TF` value of 6 (the “database” search term appears 6 times in record `id 6`) and an `IDF` value of 0.42596873216370745, which is calculated as follows (where 8 is the total number of records and 3 is the number of records that the search term appears in):

```
${IDF} = LOG10( 8 / 3 ) = 0.42596873216370745
```

The `TF` and `IDF` values are then entered into the ranking formula:

```
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

Performing the calculation in the MySQL command-line client returns a ranking value of 1.088696164686938.

```
mysql> SELECT 6*LOG10(8/3)*LOG10(8/3);
+-------------------------+
| 6*LOG10(8/3)*LOG10(8/3) |
+-------------------------+
|       1.088696164686938 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note

You may notice a slight difference in the ranking values returned by the `SELECT ... MATCH ... AGAINST` statement and the MySQL command-line client (`1.0886961221694946` versus `1.088696164686938`). The difference is due to how the casts between integers and floats/doubles are performed internally by `InnoDB` (along with related precision and rounding decisions), and how they are performed elsewhere, such as in the MySQL command-line client or other types of calculators.

##### Relevancy Ranking for a Multiple Word Search

This example demonstrates the relevancy ranking calculation for a multiple-word full-text search based on the `articles` table and data used in the previous example.

If you search on more than one word, the relevancy ranking value is a sum of the relevancy ranking value for each word, as shown in this formula:

```
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF} + ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

Performing a search on two terms ('mysql tutorial') returns the following results:

```
mysql> SELECT id, title, body, MATCH (title,body)
    ->   AGAINST ('mysql tutorial' IN BOOLEAN MODE) AS score
    ->   FROM articles ORDER BY score DESC;
+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------+
| id | title                        | body                                | score                |

+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

In the first record (`id 8`), 'mysql' appears once and 'tutorial' appears twice. There are six matching records for 'mysql' and two matching records for 'tutorial'. The MySQL command-line client returns the expected ranking value when inserting these values into the ranking formula for a multiple word search:

```
mysql> SELECT (1*log10(8/6)*log10(8/6)) + (2*log10(8/2)*log10(8/2));
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| (1*log10(8/6)*log10(8/6)) + (2*log10(8/2)*log10(8/2)) |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                                    0.7405621541938003 |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note

The slight difference in the ranking values returned by the `SELECT ... MATCH ... AGAINST` statement and the MySQL command-line client is explained in the preceding example.
