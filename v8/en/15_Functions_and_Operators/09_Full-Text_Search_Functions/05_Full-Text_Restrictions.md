### 14.9.5 Full-Text Restrictions

* Full-text searches are supported for `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` tables only.

* Full-text searches are not supported for partitioned tables. See Section 26.6, “Restrictions and Limitations on Partitioning”.

* Full-text searches can be used with most multibyte character sets. The exception is that for Unicode, the `utf8mb3` or `utf8mb4` character set can be used, but not the `ucs2` character set. Although `FULLTEXT` indexes on `ucs2` columns cannot be used, you can perform `IN BOOLEAN MODE` searches on a `ucs2` column that has no such index.

  The remarks for `utf8mb3` also apply to `utf8mb4`, and the remarks for `ucs2` also apply to `utf16`, `utf16le`, and `utf32`.

* Ideographic languages such as Chinese and Japanese do not have word delimiters. Therefore, the built-in full-text parser *cannot determine where words begin and end in these and other such languages*.

  A character-based ngram full-text parser that supports Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), and a word-based MeCab parser plugin that supports Japanese are provided for use with `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` tables.

* Although the use of multiple character sets within a single table is supported, all columns in a `FULLTEXT` index must use the same character set and collation.

* The `MATCH()` column list must match exactly the column list in some `FULLTEXT` index definition for the table, unless this `MATCH()` is `IN BOOLEAN MODE` on a `MyISAM` table. For `MyISAM` tables, boolean-mode searches can be done on nonindexed columns, although they are likely to be slow.

* The argument to `AGAINST()` must be a string value that is constant during query evaluation. This rules out, for example, a table column because that can differ for each row.

  As of MySQL 8.0.28, the argument to `MATCH()` cannot use a rollup column.

* Index hints are more limited for `FULLTEXT` searches than for non-`FULLTEXT` searches. See Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”.

* For `InnoDB`, all DML operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) involving columns with full-text indexes are processed at transaction commit time. For example, for an `INSERT` operation, an inserted string is tokenized and decomposed into individual words. The individual words are then added to full-text index tables when the transaction is committed. As a result, full-text searches only return committed data.

* The '%' character is not a supported wildcard character for full-text searches.
