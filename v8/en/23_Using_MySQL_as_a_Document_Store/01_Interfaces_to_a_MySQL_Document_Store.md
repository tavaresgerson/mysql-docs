## 22.1 Interfaces to a MySQL Document Store

To work with MySQL as a document store, you use dedicated components and a choice of clients that support communicating with the MySQL server to develop document based applications.

* The following MySQL products support X Protocol and enable you to use X DevAPI in your chosen language to develop applications that communicate with a MySQL Server functioning as a document store:

  + MySQL Shell (which provides implementations of X DevAPI in JavaScript and Python)

  + Connector/C++
  + Connector/J
  + Connector/Node.js
  + Connector/NET
  + Connector/Python
* MySQL Shell is an interactive interface to MySQL supporting JavaScript, Python, or SQL modes. You can use MySQL Shell to prototype applications, execute queries and update data. Installing MySQL Shell has instructions to download and install MySQL Shell.

* The quick-start guides (tutorials) in this chapter help you to get started using MySQL Shell with MySQL as a document store.

  The quick-start guide for JavaScript is here: Section 22.3, “JavaScript Quick-Start Guide: MySQL Shell for Document Store”.

  The quick-start guide for Python is here: Section 22.4, “Python Quick-Start Guide: MySQL Shell for Document Store”.
