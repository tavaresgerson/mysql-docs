This chapter discusses user-defined partitioning.

Note

Table partitioning differs from partitioning as used by window functions. For information about window functions, see Section 14.20, “Window Functions”.

In MySQL 8.0, partitioning support is provided by the `InnoDB` and `NDB` storage engines.

MySQL 8.0 does not currently support partitioning of tables using any storage engine other than `InnoDB` or `NDB`, such as `MyISAM`. An attempt to create a partitioned tables using a storage engine that does not supply native partitioning support fails with `ER_CHECK_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.

MySQL 8.0 Community binaries provided by Oracle include partitioning support provided by the `InnoDB` and `NDB` storage engines. For information about partitioning support offered in MySQL Enterprise Edition binaries, see Chapter 32, *MySQL Enterprise Edition*.

If you are compiling MySQL 8.0 from source, configuring the build with `InnoDB` support is sufficient to produce binaries with partition support for `InnoDB` tables. For more information, see Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”.

Nothing further needs to be done to enable partitioning support by `InnoDB` (for example, no special entries are required in the `my.cnf` file).

It is not possible to disable partitioning support by the `InnoDB` storage engine.

See Section 26.1, “Overview of Partitioning in MySQL”, for an introduction to partitioning and partitioning concepts.

Several types of partitioning are supported, as well as subpartitioning; see Section 26.2, “Partitioning Types”, and Section 26.2.6, “Subpartitioning”.

Section 26.3, “Partition Management”, covers methods of adding, removing, and altering partitions in existing partitioned tables.

Section 26.3.4, “Maintenance of Partitions”, discusses table maintenance commands for use with partitioned tables.

The `PARTITIONS` table in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` database provides information about partitions and partitioned tables. See Section 28.3.21, “The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table”, for more information; for some examples of queries against this table, see Section 26.2.7, “How MySQL Partitioning Handles NULL”.

For known issues with partitioning in MySQL 8.0, see Section 26.6, “Restrictions and Limitations on Partitioning”.
