### 28.3.38 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLES Table

The `TABLES` table provides information about tables in databases.

Columns in `TABLES` that represent table statistics hold cached values. The `information_schema_stats_expiry` system variable defines the period of time before cached table statistics expire. The default is 86400 seconds (24 hours). If there are no cached statistics or statistics have expired, statistics are retrieved from storage engines when querying table statistics columns. To update cached values at any time for a given table, use `ANALYZE TABLE`. To always retrieve the latest statistics directly from storage engines, set `information_schema_stats_expiry` to `0`. For more information, see Section 10.2.3, “Optimizing INFORMATION_SCHEMA Queries”.

Note

If the `innodb_read_only` system variable is enabled, `ANALYZE TABLE` may fail because it cannot update statistics tables in the data dictionary, which use `InnoDB`. For `ANALYZE TABLE` operations that update the key distribution, failure may occur even if the operation updates the table itself (for example, if it is a `MyISAM` table). To obtain the updated distribution statistics, set `information_schema_stats_expiry=0`.

The `TABLES` table has these columns:

* `TABLE_CATALOG`

  The name of the catalog to which the table belongs. This value is always `def`.

* `TABLE_SCHEMA`

  The name of the schema (database) to which the table belongs.

* `TABLE_NAME`

  The name of the table.

* `TABLE_TYPE`

  `BASE TABLE` for a table, `VIEW` for a view, or `SYSTEM VIEW` for an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` table.

  The `TABLES` table does not list `TEMPORARY` tables.

* `ENGINE`

  The storage engine for the table. See Chapter 17, *The InnoDB Storage Engine*, and Chapter 18, *Alternative Storage Engines*.

  For partitioned tables, `ENGINE` shows the name of the storage engine used by all partitions.

* `VERSION`

  This column is unused. With the removal of `.frm` files in MySQL 8.0, this column now reports a hardcoded value of `10`, which is the last `.frm` file version used in MySQL 5.7.

* `ROW_FORMAT`

  The row-storage format (`Fixed`, `Dynamic`, `Compressed`, `Redundant`, `Compact`). For `MyISAM` tables, `Dynamic` corresponds to what **myisamchk -dvv** reports as `Packed`.

* `TABLE_ROWS`

  The number of rows. Some storage engines, such as `MyISAM`, store the exact count. For other storage engines, such as `InnoDB`, this value is an approximation, and may vary from the actual value by as much as 40% to 50%. In such cases, use `SELECT COUNT(*)` to obtain an accurate count.

  `TABLE_ROWS` is `NULL` for `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables.

  For `InnoDB` tables, the row count is only a rough estimate used in SQL optimization. (This is also true if the `InnoDB` table is partitioned.)

* `AVG_ROW_LENGTH`

  The average row length.

* `DATA_LENGTH`

  For `MyISAM`, `DATA_LENGTH` is the length of the data file, in bytes.

  For `InnoDB`, `DATA_LENGTH` is the approximate amount of space allocated for the clustered index, in bytes. Specifically, it is the clustered index size, in pages, multiplied by the `InnoDB` page size.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for information regarding other storage engines.

* `MAX_DATA_LENGTH`

  For `MyISAM`, `MAX_DATA_LENGTH` is maximum length of the data file. This is the total number of bytes of data that can be stored in the table, given the data pointer size used.

  Unused for `InnoDB`.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for information regarding other storage engines.

* `INDEX_LENGTH`

  For `MyISAM`, `INDEX_LENGTH` is the length of the index file, in bytes.

  For `InnoDB`, `INDEX_LENGTH` is the approximate amount of space allocated for non-clustered indexes, in bytes. Specifically, it is the sum of non-clustered index sizes, in pages, multiplied by the `InnoDB` page size.

  Refer to the notes at the end of this section for information regarding other storage engines.

* `DATA_FREE`

  The number of allocated but unused bytes.

  `InnoDB` tables report the free space of the tablespace to which the table belongs. For a table located in the shared tablespace, this is the free space of the shared tablespace. If you are using multiple tablespaces and the table has its own tablespace, the free space is for only that table. Free space means the number of bytes in completely free extents minus a safety margin. Even if free space displays as 0, it may be possible to insert rows as long as new extents need not be allocated.

  For NDB Cluster, `DATA_FREE` shows the space allocated on disk for, but not used by, a Disk Data table or fragment on disk. (In-memory data resource usage is reported by the `DATA_LENGTH` column.)

  For partitioned tables, this value is only an estimate and may not be absolutely correct. A more accurate method of obtaining this information in such cases is to query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` `PARTITIONS` table, as shown in this example:

  ```
  SELECT SUM(DATA_FREE)
      FROM  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS
      WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'mydb'
      AND   TABLE_NAME   = 'mytable';
  ```

  For more information, see Section 28.3.21, “The INFORMATION_SCHEMA PARTITIONS Table”.

* `AUTO_INCREMENT`

  The next `AUTO_INCREMENT` value.

* `CREATE_TIME`

  When the table was created.

* `UPDATE_TIME`

  When the table was last updated. For some storage engines, this value is `NULL`. Even with file-per-table mode with each `InnoDB` table in a separate `.ibd` file, change buffering can delay the write to the data file, so the file modification time is different from the time of the last insert, update, or delete. For `MyISAM`, the data file timestamp is used; however, on Windows the timestamp is not updated by updates, so the value is inaccurate.

  `UPDATE_TIME` displays a timestamp value for the last `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, or `DELETE` performed on `InnoDB` tables that are not partitioned. For MVCC, the timestamp value reflects the `COMMIT` time, which is considered the last update time. Timestamps are not persisted when the server is restarted or when the table is evicted from the `InnoDB` data dictionary cache.

* `CHECK_TIME`

  When the table was last checked. Not all storage engines update this time, in which case, the value is always `NULL`.

  For partitioned `InnoDB` tables, `CHECK_TIME` is always `NULL`.

* `TABLE_COLLATION`

  The table default collation. The output does not explicitly list the table default character set, but the collation name begins with the character set name.

* `CHECKSUM`

  The live checksum value, if any.

* `CREATE_OPTIONS`

  Extra options used with `CREATE TABLE`.

  `CREATE_OPTIONS` shows `partitioned` for a partitioned table.

  Prior to MySQL 8.0.16, `CREATE_OPTIONS` shows the `ENCRYPTION` clause specified for tables created in file-per-table tablespaces. As of MySQL 8.0.16, it shows the encryption clause for file-per-table tablespaces if the table is encrypted or if the specified encryption differs from the schema encryption. The encryption clause is not shown for tables created in general tablespaces. To identify encrypted file-per-table and general tablespaces, query the `INNODB_TABLESPACES` `ENCRYPTION` column.

  When creating a table with strict mode disabled, the storage engine's default row format is used if the specified row format is not supported. The actual row format of the table is reported in the `ROW_FORMAT` column. `CREATE_OPTIONS` shows the row format that was specified in the `CREATE TABLE` statement.

  When altering the storage engine of a table, table options that are not applicable to the new storage engine are retained in the table definition to enable reverting the table with its previously defined options to the original storage engine, if necessary. The `CREATE_OPTIONS` column may show retained options.

* `TABLE_COMMENT`

  The comment used when creating the table (or information as to why MySQL could not access the table information).

#### Notes

* For `NDB` tables, the output of this statement shows appropriate values for the `AVG_ROW_LENGTH` and `DATA_LENGTH` columns, with the exception that `BLOB` columns are not taken into account.

* For `NDB` tables, `DATA_LENGTH` includes data stored in main memory only; the `MAX_DATA_LENGTH` and `DATA_FREE` columns apply to Disk Data.

* For NDB Cluster Disk Data tables, `MAX_DATA_LENGTH` shows the space allocated for the disk part of a Disk Data table or fragment. (In-memory data resource usage is reported by the `DATA_LENGTH` column.)

* For `MEMORY` tables, the `DATA_LENGTH`, `MAX_DATA_LENGTH`, and `INDEX_LENGTH` values approximate the actual amount of allocated memory. The allocation algorithm reserves memory in large amounts to reduce the number of allocation operations.

* For views, most `TABLES` columns are 0 or `NULL` except that `TABLE_NAME` indicates the view name, `CREATE_TIME` indicates the creation time, and `TABLE_COMMENT` says `VIEW`.

Table information is also available from the `SHOW TABLE STATUS` and `SHOW TABLES` statements. See Section 15.7.7.38, “SHOW TABLE STATUS Statement”, and Section 15.7.7.39, “SHOW TABLES Statement”. The following statements are equivalent:

```
SELECT
    TABLE_NAME, ENGINE, VERSION, ROW_FORMAT, TABLE_ROWS, AVG_ROW_LENGTH,
    DATA_LENGTH, MAX_DATA_LENGTH, INDEX_LENGTH, DATA_FREE, AUTO_INCREMENT,
    CREATE_TIME, UPDATE_TIME, CHECK_TIME, TABLE_COLLATION, CHECKSUM,
    CREATE_OPTIONS, TABLE_COMMENT
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
  WHERE table_schema = 'db_name'
  [AND table_name LIKE 'wild']

SHOW TABLE STATUS
  FROM db_name
  [LIKE 'wild']
```

The following statements are equivalent:

```
SELECT
  TABLE_NAME, TABLE_TYPE
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
  WHERE table_schema = 'db_name'
  [AND table_name LIKE 'wild']

SHOW FULL TABLES
  FROM db_name
  [LIKE 'wild']
```
