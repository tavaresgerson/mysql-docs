#### B.3.2.10 The table is full

If a table-full error occurs, it may be that the disk is full or that the table has reached its maximum size. The effective maximum table size for MySQL databases is usually determined by operating system constraints on file sizes, not by MySQL internal limits. See Section 10.4.6, “Limits on Table Size”.
