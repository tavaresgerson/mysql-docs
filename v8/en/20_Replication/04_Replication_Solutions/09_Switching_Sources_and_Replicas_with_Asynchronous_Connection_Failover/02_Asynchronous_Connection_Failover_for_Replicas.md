#### 19.4.9.2 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Replicas

In MySQL 8.0.27 and later, asynchronous connection failover for replicas is activated automatically for a replication channel on a Group Replication primary when you set `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1` in the `CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO` statement for the channel. The feature is designed for a group of senders and a group of receivers to keep synchronized with each other even when some members are temporarily unavailable. When the feature is active and correctly configured, if the primary that is replicating goes offline or into an error state, the new primary starts replication on the same channel when it is elected. The new primary uses the source list for the channel to select the source with the highest priority (weight) setting, which might not be the same as the original source.

To configure this feature, the replication channel and the replication user account and password for the channel must be set up on all the member servers in the replication group, and on any new joining members. Ensure that `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` and `SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY` are set to minimal numbers that just allow a few retry attempts, for example 3 and 10. You can set up the replication channel using `CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`, or if the new servers are provisioned using MySQL's clone functionality, this all happens automatically. The `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER` setting for the channel is broadcast to group members from the primary when they join. If you later disable `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER` for the channel on the primary, this is also broadcast to the secondary servers, and they change the status of the channel to match.

Note

A server participating in a group in single-primary mode must be started with `--skip-replica-start=ON`. Otherwise, the server cannot join the group as a secondary.

Asynchronous connection failover for replicas is activated and deactivated using the Group Replication member action `mysql_start_failover_channels_if_primary`, which is enabled by default. You can disable it for the whole group by disabling that member action on the primary, using the `group_replication_disable_member_action` function, as in this example:

```
mysql> SELECT group_replication_disable_member_action("mysql_start_failover_channels_if_primary", "AFTER_PRIMARY_ELECTION");
```

The function can only be changed on a primary, and must be enabled or disabled for the whole group, so you cannot have some members providing failover and others not. When the `mysql_start_failover_channels_if_primary` member action is disabled, the channel does not need to be configured on secondary members, but if the primary goes offline or into an error state, replication stops for the channel. Note that if there is more than one channel with `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1` , the member action covers all the channels, so they cannot be individually enabled and disabled by that method. Set `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=0` on the primary to disable an individual channel.

The source list for a channel with `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1` is broadcast to all group members when they join, and also when it changes. This is the case whether the sources are a managed group for which the membership is updated automatically, or whether they are added or changed manually using `asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source()`, `asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_source()`, `asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed()`, or `asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_managed()`. All group members receive the current source list as recorded in the `mysql.replication_asynchronous_connection_failover` and `mysql.replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed` tables. Because the sources do not have to be in a managed group, you can set up the function to synchronize a group of receivers with one or more alternative standalone senders, or even a single sender. A standalone replica that is not part of a replication group cannot use this feature.
