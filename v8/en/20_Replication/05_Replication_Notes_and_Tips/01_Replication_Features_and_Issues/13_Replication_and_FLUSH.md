#### 19.5.1.13 Replication and FLUSH

Some forms of the `FLUSH` statement are not logged because they could cause problems if replicated to a replica: `FLUSH LOGS` and `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`. For a syntax example, see Section 15.7.8.3, “FLUSH Statement”. The `FLUSH TABLES`, `ANALYZE TABLE`, `OPTIMIZE TABLE`, and `REPAIR TABLE` statements are written to the binary log and thus replicated to replicas. This is not normally a problem because these statements do not modify table data.

However, this behavior can cause difficulties under certain circumstances. If you replicate the privilege tables in the `mysql` database and update those tables directly without using `GRANT`, you must issue a `FLUSH PRIVILEGES` on the replicas to put the new privileges into effect. In addition, if you use `FLUSH TABLES` when renaming a `MyISAM` table that is part of a `MERGE` table, you must issue `FLUSH TABLES` manually on the replicas. These statements are written to the binary log unless you specify `NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG` or its alias `LOCAL`.
