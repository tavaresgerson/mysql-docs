# Chapter 35 Telemetry

The OpenTelemetry (OTel) project is an open-source, vendor-neutral observability framework, providing a common observability standard. It enables users to instrument their applications in order to export observability data: traces, metrics and logs, enabling increased granularity of debugging and testing.
