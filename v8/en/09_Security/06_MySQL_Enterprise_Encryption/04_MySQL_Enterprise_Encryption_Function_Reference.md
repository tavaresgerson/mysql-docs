### 8.6.4 MySQL Enterprise Encryption Function Reference

In releases from MySQL 8.0.30, MySQL Enterprise Encryption's functions are provided by the MySQL component `component_enterprise_encryption`. For their descriptions, see Section 8.6.5, “MySQL Enterprise Encryption Component Function Descriptions”.

In releases before MySQL 8.0.30, MySQL Enterprise Encryption's functions are based on the `openssl_udf` shared library. The functions continue to be available in later releases if they have been installed, but they are deprecated. For their descriptions, see Section 8.6.6, “MySQL Enterprise Encryption Legacy Function Descriptions”.

For information on upgrading to the new component functions provided by the MySQL component `component_enterprise_encryption`, and a list of the behavior differences between the legacy functions and the component functions, see Upgrading MySQL Enterprise Encryption.
