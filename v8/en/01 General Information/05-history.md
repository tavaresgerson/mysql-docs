### 1.2.3 History of MySQL

We started out with the intention of using the `mSQL` database system to connect to our tables using our own fast low-level (ISAM) routines. However, after some testing, we came to the conclusion that `mSQL` was not fast enough or flexible enough for our needs. This resulted in a new SQL interface to our database but with almost the same API interface as `mSQL`. This API was designed to enable third-party code that was written for use with `mSQL` to be ported easily for use with MySQL.

MySQL is named after co-founder Monty Widenius's daughter, My.

The name of the MySQL Dolphin (our logo) is “Sakila,” which was chosen from a huge list of names suggested by users in our “Name the Dolphin” contest. The winning name was submitted by Ambrose Twebaze, an Open Source software developer from Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Africa. According to Ambrose, the feminine name Sakila has its roots in SiSwati, the local language of Eswatini. Sakila is also the name of a town in Arusha, Tanzania, near Ambrose's country of origin, Uganda.
