[17.2.2 Deploying Group Replication Locally](group-replication-deploying-locally.html)

MySQL Group Replication is provided as a plugin for the MySQL server; each server in a group requires configuration and installation of the plugin. This section provides a detailed tutorial with the steps required to create a replication group with at least three members.

Tip

An alternative way to deploy multiple instances of MySQL is by using InnoDB Cluster, which uses Group Replication and wraps it in a programmatic environment that enables you to easily work with groups of MySQL server instances in the [MySQL Shell 8.0](/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/). In addition, InnoDB Cluster interfaces seamlessly with MySQL Router and simplifies deploying MySQL with high availability. See [MySQL AdminAPI](/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/admin-api-userguide.html).
