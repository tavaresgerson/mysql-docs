# Chapter 18 MySQL Shell

MySQL Shell is an advanced client and code editor for MySQL Server. In addition to the provided SQL functionality, similar to **mysql**, MySQL Shell provides scripting capabilities for JavaScript and Python and includes APIs for working with MySQL. MySQL Shell is a component that you can install separately.

The following discussion briefly describes MySQL Shell's capabilities. For more information, see the MySQL Shell manual, available at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/en/.

MySQL Shell includes the following APIs implemented in JavaScript and Python which you can use to develop code that interacts with MySQL.

* The X DevAPI enables developers to work with both relational and document data when MySQL Shell is connected to a MySQL server using the X Protocol. This enables you to use MySQL as a Document Store, sometimes referred to as “using NoSQL”. For more information, see Chapter 19, *Using MySQL as a Document Store*. For documentation on the concepts and usage of X DevAPI, which is implemented in MySQL Shell, see X DevAPI User Guide.

* The AdminAPI enables database administrators to work with InnoDB Cluster, which provides an integrated solution for high availability and scalability using InnoDB based MySQL databases, without requiring advanced MySQL expertise. The AdminAPI also includes support for InnoDB ReplicaSet, which enables you to administer a set of MySQL instances running asynchronous GTID-based replication in a similar way to InnoDB Cluster. Additionally, the AdminAPI makes administration of MySQL Router easier, including integration with both InnoDB Cluster and InnoDB ReplicaSet. See MySQL AdminAPI.

MySQL Shell is available in two editions, the Community Edition and the Commercial Edition. The Community Edition is available free of charge. The Commercial Edition provides additional Enterprise features at low cost.
