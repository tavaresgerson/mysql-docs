#### 14.9.1.1 Overview of Table Compression

Because processors and cache memories have increased in speed more than disk storage devices, many workloads are disk-bound. Data compression enables smaller database size, reduced I/O, and improved throughput, at the small cost of increased CPU utilization. Compression is especially valuable for read-intensive applications, on systems with enough RAM to keep frequently used data in memory.

An `InnoDB` table created with `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED` can use a smaller page size on disk than the configured `innodb_page_size` value. Smaller pages require less I/O to read from and write to disk, which is especially valuable for SSD devices.

The compressed page size is specified through the `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` parameter. The different page size requires that the table be placed in a file-per-table tablespace or general tablespace rather than in the system tablespace, as the system tablespace cannot store compressed tables. For more information, see Section 14.6.3.2, “File-Per-Table Tablespaces”, and Section 14.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”.

The level of compression is the same regardless of the `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` value. As you specify smaller values for `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE`, you get the I/O benefits of increasingly smaller pages. But if you specify a value that is too small, there is additional overhead to reorganize the pages when data values cannot be compressed enough to fit multiple rows in each page. There is a hard limit on how small `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` can be for a table, based on the lengths of the key columns for each of its indexes. Specify a value that is too small, and the `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` statement fails.

In the buffer pool, the compressed data is held in small pages, with a page size based on the `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` value. For extracting or updating the column values, MySQL also creates an uncompressed page in the buffer pool with the uncompressed data. Within the buffer pool, any updates to the uncompressed page are also re-written back to the equivalent compressed page. You might need to size your buffer pool to accommodate the additional data of both compressed and uncompressed pages, although the uncompressed pages are evicted from the buffer pool when space is needed, and then uncompressed again on the next access.
