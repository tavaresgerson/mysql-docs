#### B.3.2.1 Access denied

An `Access denied` error can have many causes. Often the problem is related to the MySQL accounts that the server permits client programs to use when connecting. See [Section 6.2, “Access Control and Account Management”](access-control.html "6.2 Access Control and Account Management"), and [Section 6.2.17, “Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL”](problems-connecting.html "6.2.17 Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL").
