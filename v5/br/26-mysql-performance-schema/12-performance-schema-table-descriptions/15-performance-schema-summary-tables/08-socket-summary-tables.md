#### 25.12.15.8 Socket Summary Tables

These socket summary tables aggregate timer and byte count information for socket operations:

* [`socket_summary_by_event_name`](performance-schema-socket-summary-tables.html "25.12.15.8 Socket Summary Tables"): Aggregate timer and byte count statistics generated by the `wait/io/socket/*` instruments for all socket I/O operations, per socket instrument.

* [`socket_summary_by_instance`](performance-schema-socket-summary-tables.html "25.12.15.8 Socket Summary Tables"): Aggregate timer and byte count statistics generated by the `wait/io/socket/*` instruments for all socket I/O operations, per socket instance. When a connection terminates, the row in [`socket_summary_by_instance`](performance-schema-socket-summary-tables.html "25.12.15.8 Socket Summary Tables") corresponding to it is deleted.

The socket summary tables do not aggregate waits generated by `idle` events while sockets are waiting for the next request from the client. For `idle` event aggregations, use the wait-event summary tables; see [Section 25.12.15.1, “Wait Event Summary Tables”](performance-schema-wait-summary-tables.html "25.12.15.1 Wait Event Summary Tables").

Each socket summary table has one or more grouping columns to indicate how the table aggregates events. Event names refer to names of event instruments in the [`setup_instruments`](performance-schema-setup-instruments-table.html "25.12.2.3 The setup_instruments Table") table:

* [`socket_summary_by_event_name`](performance-schema-socket-summary-tables.html "25.12.15.8 Socket Summary Tables") has an `EVENT_NAME` column. Each row summarizes events for a given event name.

* [`socket_summary_by_instance`](performance-schema-socket-summary-tables.html "25.12.15.8 Socket Summary Tables") has an `OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN` column. Each row summarizes events for a given object.

Each socket summary table has these summary columns containing aggregated values:

* `COUNT_STAR`, `SUM_TIMER_WAIT`, `MIN_TIMER_WAIT`, `AVG_TIMER_WAIT`, `MAX_TIMER_WAIT`

  These columns aggregate all operations.

* `COUNT_READ`, `SUM_TIMER_READ`, `MIN_TIMER_READ`, `AVG_TIMER_READ`, `MAX_TIMER_READ`, `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_READ`

  These columns aggregate all receive operations (`RECV`, `RECVFROM`, and `RECVMSG`).

* `COUNT_WRITE`, `SUM_TIMER_WRITE`, `MIN_TIMER_WRITE`, `AVG_TIMER_WRITE`, `MAX_TIMER_WRITE`, `SUM_NUMBER_OF_BYTES_WRITE`

  These columns aggregate all send operations (`SEND`, `SENDTO`, and `SENDMSG`).

* `COUNT_MISC`, `SUM_TIMER_MISC`, `MIN_TIMER_MISC`, `AVG_TIMER_MISC`, `MAX_TIMER_MISC`

  These columns aggregate all other socket operations, such as `CONNECT`, `LISTEN`, `ACCEPT`, `CLOSE`, and `SHUTDOWN`. There are no byte counts for these operations.

The [`socket_summary_by_instance`](performance-schema-socket-summary-tables.html "25.12.15.8 Socket Summary Tables") table also has an `EVENT_NAME` column that indicates the class of the socket: `client_connection`, `server_tcpip_socket`, `server_unix_socket`. This column can be grouped on to isolate, for example, client activity from that of the server listening sockets.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.html "13.1.34 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for socket summary tables. Except for [`events_statements_summary_by_digest`](performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.html "25.12.15.3 Statement Summary Tables"), tt resets the summary columns to zero rather than removing rows.
