### 13.1.20 CREATE TRIGGER Statement

```sql
CREATE
    [DEFINER = user]
    TRIGGER trigger_name
    trigger_time trigger_event
    ON tbl_name FOR EACH ROW
    [trigger_order]
    trigger_body

trigger_time: { BEFORE | AFTER }

trigger_event: { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE }

trigger_order: { FOLLOWS | PRECEDES } other_trigger_name
```

This statement creates a new trigger. A trigger is a named database object that is associated with a table, and that activates when a particular event occurs for the table. The trigger becomes associated with the table named *`tbl_name`*, which must refer to a permanent table. You cannot associate a trigger with a `TEMPORARY` table or a view.

Trigger names exist in the schema namespace, meaning that all triggers must have unique names within a schema. Triggers in different schemas can have the same name.

This section describes [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.html "13.1.20 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") syntax. For additional discussion, see [Section 23.3.1, “Trigger Syntax and Examples”](trigger-syntax.html "23.3.1 Trigger Syntax and Examples").

[`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.html "13.1.20 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") requires the [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.html#priv_trigger) privilege for the table associated with the trigger. If the `DEFINER` clause is present, the privileges required depend on the *`user`* value, as discussed in [Section 23.6, “Stored Object Access Control”](stored-objects-security.html "23.6 Stored Object Access Control"). If binary logging is enabled, [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.html "13.1.20 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") might require the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.html#priv_super) privilege, as discussed in [Section 23.7, “Stored Program Binary Logging”](stored-programs-logging.html "23.7 Stored Program Binary Logging").

The `DEFINER` clause determines the security context to be used when checking access privileges at trigger activation time, as described later in this section.

*`trigger_time`* is the trigger action time. It can be `BEFORE` or `AFTER` to indicate that the trigger activates before or after each row to be modified.

Basic column value checks occur prior to trigger activation, so you cannot use `BEFORE` triggers to convert values inappropriate for the column type to valid values.

*`trigger_event`* indicates the kind of operation that activates the trigger. These *`trigger_event`* values are permitted:

* [`INSERT`](insert.html "13.2.5 INSERT Statement"): The trigger activates whenever a new row is inserted into the table (for example, through [`INSERT`](insert.html "13.2.5 INSERT Statement"), [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement"), and [`REPLACE`](replace.html "13.2.8 REPLACE Statement") statements).

* [`UPDATE`](update.html "13.2.11 UPDATE Statement"): The trigger activates whenever a row is modified (for example, through [`UPDATE`](update.html "13.2.11 UPDATE Statement") statements).

* [`DELETE`](delete.html "13.2.2 DELETE Statement"): The trigger activates whenever a row is deleted from the table (for example, through [`DELETE`](delete.html "13.2.2 DELETE Statement") and [`REPLACE`](replace.html "13.2.8 REPLACE Statement") statements). [`DROP TABLE`](drop-table.html "13.1.29 DROP TABLE Statement") and [`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.html "13.1.34 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") statements on the table do *not* activate this trigger, because they do not use [`DELETE`](delete.html "13.2.2 DELETE Statement"). Dropping a partition does not activate [`DELETE`](delete.html "13.2.2 DELETE Statement") triggers, either.

The *`trigger_event`* does not represent a literal type of SQL statement that activates the trigger so much as it represents a type of table operation. For example, an [`INSERT`](insert.html "13.2.5 INSERT Statement") trigger activates not only for [`INSERT`](insert.html "13.2.5 INSERT Statement") statements but also [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") statements because both statements insert rows into a table.

A potentially confusing example of this is the `INSERT INTO ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ...` syntax: a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger activates for every row, followed by either an `AFTER INSERT` trigger or both the `BEFORE UPDATE` and `AFTER UPDATE` triggers, depending on whether there was a duplicate key for the row.

Note

Cascaded foreign key actions do not activate triggers.

It is possible to define multiple triggers for a given table that have the same trigger event and action time. For example, you can have two `BEFORE UPDATE` triggers for a table. By default, triggers that have the same trigger event and action time activate in the order they were created. To affect trigger order, specify a *`trigger_order`* clause that indicates `FOLLOWS` or `PRECEDES` and the name of an existing trigger that also has the same trigger event and action time. With `FOLLOWS`, the new trigger activates after the existing trigger. With `PRECEDES`, the new trigger activates before the existing trigger.

*`trigger_body`* is the statement to execute when the trigger activates. To execute multiple statements, use the [`BEGIN ... END`](begin-end.html "13.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") compound statement construct. This also enables you to use the same statements that are permitted within stored routines. See [Section 13.6.1, “BEGIN ... END Compound Statement”](begin-end.html "13.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement"). Some statements are not permitted in triggers; see [Section 23.8, “Restrictions on Stored Programs”](stored-program-restrictions.html "23.8 Restrictions on Stored Programs").

Within the trigger body, you can refer to columns in the subject table (the table associated with the trigger) by using the aliases `OLD` and `NEW`. `OLD.col_name` refers to a column of an existing row before it is updated or deleted. `NEW.col_name` refers to the column of a new row to be inserted or an existing row after it is updated.

Triggers cannot use `NEW.col_name` or use `OLD.col_name` to refer to generated columns. For information about generated columns, see [Section 13.1.18.7, “CREATE TABLE and Generated Columns”](create-table-generated-columns.html "13.1.18.7 CREATE TABLE and Generated Columns").

MySQL stores the [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.html#sysvar_sql_mode) system variable setting in effect when a trigger is created, and always executes the trigger body with this setting in force, *regardless of the current server SQL mode when the trigger begins executing*.

The `DEFINER` clause specifies the MySQL account to be used when checking access privileges at trigger activation time. If the `DEFINER` clause is present, the *`user`* value should be a MySQL account specified as `'user_name'@'host_name'`, [`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.html#function_current-user), or [`CURRENT_USER()`](information-functions.html#function_current-user). The permitted *`user`* values depend on the privileges you hold, as discussed in [Section 23.6, “Stored Object Access Control”](stored-objects-security.html "23.6 Stored Object Access Control"). Also see that section for additional information about trigger security.

If the `DEFINER` clause is omitted, the default definer is the user who executes the [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.html "13.1.20 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") statement. This is the same as specifying `DEFINER = CURRENT_USER` explicitly.

MySQL takes the `DEFINER` user into account when checking trigger privileges as follows:

* At [`CREATE TRIGGER`](create-trigger.html "13.1.20 CREATE TRIGGER Statement") time, the user who issues the statement must have the [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.html#priv_trigger) privilege.

* At trigger activation time, privileges are checked against the `DEFINER` user. This user must have these privileges:

  + The [`TRIGGER`](privileges-provided.html#priv_trigger) privilege for the subject table.

  + The [`SELECT`](privileges-provided.html#priv_select) privilege for the subject table if references to table columns occur using `OLD.col_name` or `NEW.col_name` in the trigger body.

  + The [`UPDATE`](privileges-provided.html#priv_update) privilege for the subject table if table columns are targets of `SET NEW.col_name = value` assignments in the trigger body.

  + Whatever other privileges normally are required for the statements executed by the trigger.

Within a trigger body, the [`CURRENT_USER`](information-functions.html#function_current-user) function returns the account used to check privileges at trigger activation time. This is the `DEFINER` user, not the user whose actions caused the trigger to be activated. For information about user auditing within triggers, see [Section 6.2.18, “SQL-Based Account Activity Auditing”](account-activity-auditing.html "6.2.18 SQL-Based Account Activity Auditing").

If you use [`LOCK TABLES`](lock-tables.html "13.3.5 LOCK TABLES and UNLOCK TABLES Statements") to lock a table that has triggers, the tables used within the trigger are also locked, as described in [LOCK TABLES and Triggers](lock-tables.html#lock-tables-and-triggers "LOCK TABLES and Triggers").
