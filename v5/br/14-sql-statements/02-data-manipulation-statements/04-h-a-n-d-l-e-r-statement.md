### 13.2.4 HANDLER Statement

```sql
HANDLER tbl_name OPEN [ [AS] alias]

HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name { = | <= | >= | < | > } (value1,value2,...)
    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]
HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name { FIRST | NEXT | PREV | LAST }
    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]
HANDLER tbl_name READ { FIRST | NEXT }
    [ WHERE where_condition ] [LIMIT ... ]

HANDLER tbl_name CLOSE
```

The `HANDLER` statement provides direct access to table storage engine interfaces. It is available for `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` tables.

The `HANDLER ... OPEN` statement opens a table, making it accessible using subsequent `HANDLER ... READ` statements. This table object is not shared by other sessions and is not closed until the session calls `HANDLER ... CLOSE` or the session terminates.

If you open the table using an alias, further references to the open table with other `HANDLER` statements must use the alias rather than the table name. If you do not use an alias, but open the table using a table name qualified by the database name, further references must use the unqualified table name. For example, for a table opened using `mydb.mytable`, further references must use `mytable`.

The first `HANDLER ... READ` syntax fetches a row where the index specified satisfies the given values and the `WHERE` condition is met. If you have a multiple-column index, specify the index column values as a comma-separated list. Either specify values for all the columns in the index, or specify values for a leftmost prefix of the index columns. Suppose that an index `my_idx` includes three columns named `col_a`, `col_b`, and `col_c`, in that order. The `HANDLER` statement can specify values for all three columns in the index, or for the columns in a leftmost prefix. For example:

```sql
HANDLER ... READ my_idx = (col_a_val,col_b_val,col_c_val) ...
HANDLER ... READ my_idx = (col_a_val,col_b_val) ...
HANDLER ... READ my_idx = (col_a_val) ...
```

To employ the `HANDLER` interface to refer to a table's `PRIMARY KEY`, use the quoted identifier `` `PRIMARY` ``:

```sql
HANDLER tbl_name READ `PRIMARY` ...
```

The second `HANDLER ... READ` syntax fetches a row from the table in index order that matches the `WHERE` condition.

The third `HANDLER ... READ` syntax fetches a row from the table in natural row order that matches the `WHERE` condition. It is faster than `HANDLER tbl_name READ index_name` when a full table scan is desired. Natural row order is the order in which rows are stored in a `MyISAM` table data file. This statement works for `InnoDB` tables as well, but there is no such concept because there is no separate data file.

Without a `LIMIT` clause, all forms of `HANDLER ... READ` fetch a single row if one is available. To return a specific number of rows, include a `LIMIT` clause. It has the same syntax as for the [`SELECT`](select.html "13.2.9 SELECT Statement") statement. See [Section 13.2.9, “SELECT Statement”](select.html "13.2.9 SELECT Statement").

`HANDLER ... CLOSE` closes a table that was opened with `HANDLER ... OPEN`.

There are several reasons to use the `HANDLER` interface instead of normal [`SELECT`](select.html "13.2.9 SELECT Statement") statements:

* `HANDLER` is faster than [`SELECT`](select.html "13.2.9 SELECT Statement"):

  + A designated storage engine handler object is allocated for the `HANDLER ... OPEN`. The object is reused for subsequent `HANDLER` statements for that table; it need not be reinitialized for each one.

  + There is less parsing involved.
  + There is no optimizer or query-checking overhead.
  + The handler interface does not have to provide a consistent look of the data (for example, [dirty reads](glossary.html#glos_dirty_read "dirty read") are permitted), so the storage engine can use optimizations that [`SELECT`](select.html "13.2.9 SELECT Statement") does not normally permit.

* `HANDLER` makes it easier to port to MySQL applications that use a low-level `ISAM`-like interface. (See [Section 14.21, “InnoDB memcached Plugin”](innodb-memcached.html "14.21 InnoDB memcached Plugin") for an alternative way to adapt applications that use the key-value store paradigm.)

* `HANDLER` enables you to traverse a database in a manner that is difficult (or even impossible) to accomplish with [`SELECT`](select.html "13.2.9 SELECT Statement"). The `HANDLER` interface is a more natural way to look at data when working with applications that provide an interactive user interface to the database.

`HANDLER` is a somewhat low-level statement. For example, it does not provide consistency. That is, `HANDLER ... OPEN` does *not* take a snapshot of the table, and does *not* lock the table. This means that after a `HANDLER ... OPEN` statement is issued, table data can be modified (by the current session or other sessions) and these modifications might be only partially visible to `HANDLER ... NEXT` or `HANDLER ... PREV` scans.

An open handler can be closed and marked for reopen, in which case the handler loses its position in the table. This occurs when both of the following circumstances are true:

* Any session executes [`FLUSH TABLES`](flush.html#flush-tables) or DDL statements on the handler's table.

* The session in which the handler is open executes non-`HANDLER` statements that use tables.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.html "13.1.34 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") for a table closes all handlers for the table that were opened with [`HANDLER OPEN`](handler.html "13.2.4 HANDLER Statement").

If a table is flushed with [`FLUSH TABLES tbl_name WITH READ LOCK`](flush.html#flush-tables-with-read-lock-with-list) was opened with `HANDLER`, the handler is implicitly flushed and loses its position.
