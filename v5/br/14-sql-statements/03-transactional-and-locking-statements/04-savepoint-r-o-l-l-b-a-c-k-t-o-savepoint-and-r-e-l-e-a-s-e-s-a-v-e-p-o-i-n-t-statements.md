### 13.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements

```sql
SAVEPOINT identifier
ROLLBACK [WORK] TO [SAVEPOINT] identifier
RELEASE SAVEPOINT identifier
```

`InnoDB` supports the SQL statements [`SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.html "13.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements"), [`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.html "13.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements"), [`RELEASE SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.html "13.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements") and the optional `WORK` keyword for [`ROLLBACK`](commit.html "13.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements").

The [`SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.html "13.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements") statement sets a named transaction savepoint with a name of *`identifier`*. If the current transaction has a savepoint with the same name, the old savepoint is deleted and a new one is set.

The [`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.html "13.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements") statement rolls back a transaction to the named savepoint without terminating the transaction. Modifications that the current transaction made to rows after the savepoint was set are undone in the rollback, but `InnoDB` does *not* release the row locks that were stored in memory after the savepoint. (For a new inserted row, the lock information is carried by the transaction ID stored in the row; the lock is not separately stored in memory. In this case, the row lock is released in the undo.) Savepoints that were set at a later time than the named savepoint are deleted.

If the [`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.html "13.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements") statement returns the following error, it means that no savepoint with the specified name exists:

```sql
ERROR 1305 (42000): SAVEPOINT identifier does not exist
```

The [`RELEASE SAVEPOINT`](savepoint.html "13.3.4 SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT, and RELEASE SAVEPOINT Statements") statement removes the named savepoint from the set of savepoints of the current transaction. No commit or rollback occurs. It is an error if the savepoint does not exist.

All savepoints of the current transaction are deleted if you execute a [`COMMIT`](commit.html "13.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements"), or a [`ROLLBACK`](commit.html "13.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements") that does not name a savepoint.

A new savepoint level is created when a stored function is invoked or a trigger is activated. The savepoints on previous levels become unavailable and thus do not conflict with savepoints on the new level. When the function or trigger terminates, any savepoints it created are released and the previous savepoint level is restored.
