#### 16.4.1.12 Replication and Floating-Point Values

With statement-based replication, values are converted from decimal to binary. Because conversions between decimal and binary representations of them may be approximate, comparisons involving floating-point values are inexact. This is true for operations that use floating-point values explicitly, or that use values that are converted to floating-point implicitly. Comparisons of floating-point values might yield different results on source and replica servers due to differences in computer architecture, the compiler used to build MySQL, and so forth. See [Section 12.3, “Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation”](type-conversion.html "12.3 Type Conversion in Expression Evaluation"), and [Section B.3.4.8, “Problems with Floating-Point Values”](problems-with-float.html "B.3.4.8 Problems with Floating-Point Values").
