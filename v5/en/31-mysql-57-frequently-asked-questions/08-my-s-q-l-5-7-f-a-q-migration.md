Do not skip a major version when upgrading, but rather complete the process in steps, upgrading from one major version to the next in each step. This may seem more complicated, but ultimately saves time and trouble. If you encounter problems during the upgrade, their origin is easier to identify, either by you or, if you have a MySQL Enterprise subscription, by MySQL support. </p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a name="faq-mysql-how-storage-engines-changed"></a><a name="id381011"></a><p><b>A.8.2.</b></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p> How has storage engine (table type) support changed in MySQL 5.7 from previous versions? </p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p> Storage engine support has changed as follows: </p> <div class="itemizedlist"> <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p> Support for <code>ISAM</code> tables was removed in MySQL 5.0 and you should now use the <code>MyISAM</code> storage engine in place of <code>ISAM</code>.
