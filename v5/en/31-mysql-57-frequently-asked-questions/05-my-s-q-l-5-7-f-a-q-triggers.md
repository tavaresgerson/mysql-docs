For example, you can have two <code>BEFORE UPDATE</code> triggers for a table. By default, triggers that have the same trigger event and action time activate in the order they were created. To affect trigger order, specify a clause after <code>FOR EACH ROW</code> that indicates <code>FOLLOWS</code> or <code>PRECEDES</code> and the name of an existing trigger that also has the same trigger event and action time. With <code>FOLLOWS</code>, the new trigger activates after the existing trigger. With <code>PRECEDES</code>, the new trigger activates before the existing trigger. </p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><p><b>A.5.11.</b></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p> Is it possible for a trigger to update tables on a remote server? </p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p> Yes.

However, the way in which they work depends whether you are using MySQL's <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">classic</span>”</span> statement-based or row-based replication format. </p><p> When using statement-based replication, triggers on the replica are executed by statements that are executed on the source (and replicated to the replica). </p><p> When using row-based replication, triggers are not executed on the replica due to statements that were run on the source and then replicated to the replica. Instead, when using row-based replication, the changes caused by executing the trigger on the source are applied on the replica. </p><p> For more information, see Section 16.4.1.34, “Replication and Triggers”. </p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><p><b>A.5.13.</b></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p> How are actions carried out through triggers on a source replicated to a replica? </p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p> Again, this depends on whether you are using statement-based or row-based replication. </p><p><b>Statement-based replication. </b> First, the triggers that exist on a source must be re-created on the replica server. Once this is done, the replication flow works as any other standard DML statement that participates in replication. For example, consider a table <code>EMP</code> that has an <code>AFTER</code> insert trigger, which exists on a replication source server. The same <code>EMP</code> table and <code>AFTER</code> insert trigger exist on the replica server as well. The replication flow would be: </p> <div class="orderedlist"> <ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p> An <code>INSERT</code> statement is made to <code>EMP</code>. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> The <code>AFTER</code> trigger on <code>EMP</code> activates. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> The <code>INSERT</code> statement is written to the binary log. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> The replica picks up the <code>INSERT</code> statement to <code>EMP</code> and executes it. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p> The <code>AFTER</code> trigger on <code>EMP</code> that exists on the replica activates. </p></li></ol> </div> <p><b>Row-based replication. </b> When you use row-based replication, the changes caused by executing the trigger on the source are applied on the replica. However, the triggers themselves are not actually executed on the replica under row-based replication. This is because, if both the source and the replica applied the changes from the source and, in addition, the trigger causing these changes were applied on the replica, the changes would in effect be applied twice on the replica, leading to different data on the source and the replica. </p><p> In most cases, the outcome is the same for both row-based and statement-based replication. However, if you use different triggers on the source and replica, you cannot use row-based replication. (This is because the row-based format replicates the changes made by triggers executing on the source to the replicas, rather than the statements that caused the triggers to execute, and the corresponding triggers on the replica are not executed.) Instead, any statements causing such triggers to be executed must be replicated using statement-based replication. </p><p> For more information, see Section 16.4.1.34, “Replication and Triggers”. </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
