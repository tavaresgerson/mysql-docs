### 5.4.6 The DDL Log

The DDL log, or metadata log, records metadata operations generated by data definition statements affecting table partitioning, such as [`ALTER TABLE t3 DROP PARTITION p2`](alter-table-partition-operations.html "13.1.8.1 ALTER TABLE Partition Operations"), where we must make certain that the partition is completely dropped and that its definition is removed from the list of partitions for table `t3`. MySQL uses this log to recover from a crash occurring in the middle of a partitioning metadata operation.

A record of partitioning metadata operations is written to the file `ddl_log.log`, in the MySQL data directory. This is a binary file; it is not intended to be human-readable, and you should not attempt to modify its contents in any way.

`ddl_log.log` is not created until it is actually needed for recording metadata statements, and is removed following a successful start of [**mysqld**](mysqld.html "4.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). Thus, it is possible for this file not to be present on a MySQL server that is functioning in a completely normal manner.

`ddl_log.log` can hold up to 1048573 entries, equivalent to 4 GB in size. Once this limit is exceeded, you must rename or remove the file before it is possible to execute any additional DDL statements. This is a known issue (Bug #83708).

There are no user-configurable server options or variables associated with this file.
