### 2.8.3 MySQL Layout for Source Installation

By default, when you install MySQL after compiling it from source, the installation step installs files under `/usr/local/mysql`. The component locations under the installation directory are the same as for binary distributions. See Table 2.3, “MySQL Installation Layout for Generic Unix/Linux Binary Package”, and Section 2.3.1, “MySQL Installation Layout on Microsoft Windows”. To configure installation locations different from the defaults, use the options described at Section 2.8.7, “MySQL Source-Configuration Options”.
