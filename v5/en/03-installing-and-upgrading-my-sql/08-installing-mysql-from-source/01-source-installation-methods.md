### 2.8.1 Source Installation Methods

There are two methods for installing MySQL from source:

* Use a standard MySQL source distribution. To obtain a standard distribution, see Section 2.1.3, “How to Get MySQL”. For instructions on building from a standard distribution, see Section 2.8.4, “Installing MySQL Using a Standard Source Distribution”.

  Standard distributions are available as compressed **tar** files, Zip archives, or RPM packages. Distribution files have names of the form `mysql-VERSION.tar.gz`, `mysql-VERSION.zip`, or `mysql-VERSION.rpm`, where *`VERSION`* is a number like `5.7.44`. File names for source distributions can be distinguished from those for precompiled binary distributions in that source distribution names are generic and include no platform name, whereas binary distribution names include a platform name indicating the type of system for which the distribution is intended (for example, `pc-linux-i686` or `winx64`).

* Use a MySQL development tree. For information on building from one of the development trees, see Section 2.8.5, “Installing MySQL Using a Development Source Tree”.
