[21.2.4.2 What is New in NDB Cluster 7.6](mysql-cluster-what-is-new-7-6.html)

The following sections describe changes in the implementation of MySQL NDB Cluster in NDB Cluster 7.6 through 5.7.44-ndb-7.6.36 and NDB Cluster 7.5 through 5.7.44-ndb-7.5.36 as compared to earlier release series. NDB Cluster 8.0 is available as a General Availability (GA) release, beginning with NDB 8.0.19; see [What is New in MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0](/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-cluster-what-is-new.html), for more information about new features and other changes in NDB 8.0. NDB Cluster 7.6 and 7.5 are previous GA releases still supported in production; for information about NDB Cluster 7.6, see [Section 21.2.4.2, “What is New in NDB Cluster 7.6”](mysql-cluster-what-is-new-7-6.html "21.2.4.2 What is New in NDB Cluster 7.6"). For information about NDB Cluster 7.5, see [Section 21.2.4.1, “What is New in NDB Cluster 7.5”](mysql-cluster-what-is-new-7-5.html "21.2.4.1 What is New in NDB Cluster 7.5"). NDB Cluster 7.4 and 7.3 were previous GA releases which have reached their end of life, and which are no longer supported or maintained. We recommend that new deployments for production use MySQL NDB Cluster 8.0.
