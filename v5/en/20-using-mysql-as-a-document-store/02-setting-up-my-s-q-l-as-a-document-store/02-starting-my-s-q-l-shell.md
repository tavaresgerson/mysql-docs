### 19.2.2 Starting MySQL Shell

You need an account name and password to establish a session using MySQL Shell. Replace *`user`* with your account name.

On the same system where the server instance is running, open a terminal window (command prompt on Windows) and start MySQL Shell with the following command:

```sql
mysqlsh --uri user@localhost
```

You are prompted to input your password and then this establishes an X Session.

For instructions to get you started using MySQL as a document store, see the following quick-start guides:
