### 13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement

```sql
LOAD DATA
    [LOW_PRIORITY | CONCURRENT] [LOCAL]
    INFILE 'file_name'
    [REPLACE | IGNORE]
    INTO TABLE tbl_name
    [PARTITION (partition_name [, partition_name] ...)]
    [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
    [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
        [ESCAPED BY 'char']
    ]
    [LINES
        [STARTING BY 'string']
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
    ]
    [IGNORE number {LINES | ROWS}]
    [(col_name_or_user_var
        [, col_name_or_user_var] ...)]
    [SET col_name={expr | DEFAULT}
        [, col_name={expr | DEFAULT}] ...]
```

The [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") statement reads rows from a text file into a table at a very high speed. The file can be read from the server host or the client host, depending on whether the `LOCAL` modifier is given. `LOCAL` also affects data interpretation and error handling.

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") is the complement of [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"). (See [Section 13.2.9.1, “SELECT ... INTO Statement”](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement").) To write data from a table to a file, use [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement"). To read the file back into a table, use [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement"). The syntax of the `FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses is the same for both statements.

The [**mysqlimport**](mysqlimport.html "4.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program") utility provides another way to load data files; it operates by sending a [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") statement to the server. See [Section 4.5.5, “mysqlimport — A Data Import Program”](mysqlimport.html "4.5.5 mysqlimport — A Data Import Program").

#### Non-LOCAL Versus LOCAL Operation

The `LOCAL` modifier affects these aspects of [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement"), compared to non-`LOCAL` operation:

* It changes the expected location of the input file; see [Input File Location](load-data.html#load-data-file-location "Input File Location").

* It changes the statement security requirements; see [Security Requirements](load-data.html#load-data-security-requirements "Security Requirements").

* Unless `REPLACE` is also specified, `LOCAL` has the same effect as the `IGNORE` modifier on the interpretation of input file contents and error handling; see [Duplicate-Key and Error Handling](load-data.html#load-data-error-handling "Duplicate-Key and Error Handling"), and [Column Value Assignment](load-data.html#load-data-column-assignments "Column Value Assignment").

`LOCAL` works only if the server and your client both have been configured to permit it. For example, if [**mysqld**](mysqld.html "4.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server") was started with the [`local_infile`](server-system-variables.html#sysvar_local_infile) system variable disabled, `LOCAL` produces an error. See [Section 6.1.6, “Security Considerations for LOAD DATA LOCAL”](load-data-local-security.html "6.1.6 Security Considerations for LOAD DATA LOCAL").

#### Input File Character Set

The file name must be given as a literal string. On Windows, specify backslashes in path names as forward slashes or doubled backslashes. The server interprets the file name using the character set indicated by the [`character_set_filesystem`](server-system-variables.html#sysvar_character_set_filesystem) system variable.

By default, the server interprets the file contents using the character set indicated by the [`character_set_database`](server-system-variables.html#sysvar_character_set_database) system variable. If the file contents use a character set different from this default, it is a good idea to specify that character set by using the `CHARACTER SET` clause. A character set of `binary` specifies “no conversion.”

[`SET NAMES`](set-names.html "13.7.4.3 SET NAMES Statement") and the setting of [`character_set_client`](server-system-variables.html#sysvar_character_set_client) do not affect interpretation of file contents.

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") interprets all fields in the file as having the same character set, regardless of the data types of the columns into which field values are loaded. For proper interpretation of the file, you must ensure that it was written with the correct character set. For example, if you write a data file with [**mysqldump -T**](mysqldump.html "4.5.4 mysqldump — A Database Backup Program") or by issuing a [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statement in [**mysql**](mysql.html "4.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client"), be sure to use a [`--default-character-set`](mysql-command-options.html#option_mysql_default-character-set) option to write output in the character set to be used when the file is loaded with [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement").

Note

It is not possible to load data files that use the `ucs2`, `utf16`, `utf16le`, or `utf32` character set.

#### Input File Location

These rules determine the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") input file location:

* If `LOCAL` is not specified, the file must be located on the server host. The server reads the file directly, locating it as follows:

  + If the file name is an absolute path name, the server uses it as given.

  + If the file name is a relative path name with leading components, the server looks for the file relative to its data directory.

  + If the file name has no leading components, the server looks for the file in the database directory of the default database.

* If `LOCAL` is specified, the file must be located on the client host. The client program reads the file, locating it as follows:

  + If the file name is an absolute path name, the client program uses it as given.

  + If the file name is a relative path name, the client program looks for the file relative to its invocation directory.

  When `LOCAL` is used, the client program reads the file and sends its contents to the server. The server creates a copy of the file in the directory where it stores temporary files. See [Section B.3.3.5, “Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files”](temporary-files.html "B.3.3.5 Where MySQL Stores Temporary Files"). Lack of sufficient space for the copy in this directory can cause the [`LOAD DATA LOCAL`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") statement to fail.

The non-`LOCAL` rules mean that the server reads a file named as `./myfile.txt` relative to its data directory, whereas it reads a file named as `myfile.txt` from the database directory of the default database. For example, if the following [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") statement is executed while `db1` is the default database, the server reads the file `data.txt` from the database directory for `db1`, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a table in the `db2` database:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE db2.my_table;
```

#### Security Requirements

For a non-`LOCAL` load operation, the server reads a text file located on the server host, so these security requirements must be satisified:

* You must have the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.html#priv_file) privilege. See [Section 6.2.2, “Privileges Provided by MySQL”](privileges-provided.html "6.2.2 Privileges Provided by MySQL").

* The operation is subject to the [`secure_file_priv`](server-system-variables.html#sysvar_secure_file_priv) system variable setting:

  + If the variable value is a nonempty directory name, the file must be located in that directory.

  + If the variable value is empty (which is insecure), the file need only be readable by the server.

For a `LOCAL` load operation, the client program reads a text file located on the client host. Because the file contents are sent over the connection by the client to the server, using `LOCAL` is a bit slower than when the server accesses the file directly. On the other hand, you do not need the [`FILE`](privileges-provided.html#priv_file) privilege, and the file can be located in any directory the client program can access.

#### Duplicate-Key and Error Handling

The `REPLACE` and `IGNORE` modifiers control handling of new (input) rows that duplicate existing table rows on unique key values (`PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` index values):

* With `REPLACE`, new rows that have the same value as a unique key value in an existing row replace the existing row. See [Section 13.2.8, “REPLACE Statement”](replace.html "13.2.8 REPLACE Statement").

* With `IGNORE`, new rows that duplicate an existing row on a unique key value are discarded. For more information, see [The Effect of IGNORE on Statement Execution](sql-mode.html#ignore-effect-on-execution "The Effect of IGNORE on Statement Execution").

Unless `REPLACE` is also specified, the `LOCAL` modifier has the same effect as `IGNORE`. This occurs because the server has no way to stop transmission of the file in the middle of the operation.

If none of `REPLACE`, `IGNORE`, or `LOCAL` is specified, an error occurs when a duplicate key value is found, and the rest of the text file is ignored.

In addition to affecting duplicate-key handling as just described, `IGNORE` and `LOCAL` also affect error handling:

* When neither `IGNORE` nor `LOCAL` is specified, data-interpretation errors terminate the operation.

* When `IGNORE`—or `LOCAL` without `REPLACE`—is specified, data interpretation errors become warnings and the load operation continues, even if the SQL mode is restrictive. For examples, see [Column Value Assignment](load-data.html#load-data-column-assignments "Column Value Assignment").

#### Index Handling

To ignore foreign key constraints during the load operation, execute a `SET foreign_key_checks = 0` statement before executing [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement").

If you use [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") on an empty `MyISAM` table, all nonunique indexes are created in a separate batch (as for [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.html "13.7.2.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement")). Normally, this makes [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") much faster when you have many indexes. In some extreme cases, you can create the indexes even faster by turning them off with [`ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE KEYS`](alter-table.html "13.1.8 ALTER TABLE Statement") before loading the file into the table and re-creating the indexes with [`ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE KEYS`](alter-table.html "13.1.8 ALTER TABLE Statement") after loading the file. See [Section 8.2.4.1, “Optimizing INSERT Statements”](insert-optimization.html "8.2.4.1 Optimizing INSERT Statements").

#### Field and Line Handling

For both the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") and [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") statements, the syntax of the `FIELDS` and `LINES` clauses is the same. Both clauses are optional, but `FIELDS` must precede `LINES` if both are specified.

If you specify a `FIELDS` clause, each of its subclauses (`TERMINATED BY`, `[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY`, and `ESCAPED BY`) is also optional, except that you must specify at least one of them. Arguments to these clauses are permitted to contain only ASCII characters.

If you specify no `FIELDS` or `LINES` clause, the defaults are the same as if you had written this:

```sql
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' ENCLOSED BY '' ESCAPED BY '\\'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' STARTING BY ''
```

Backslash is the MySQL escape character within strings in SQL statements. Thus, to specify a literal backslash, you must specify two backslashes for the value to be interpreted as a single backslash. The escape sequences `'\t'` and `'\n'` specify tab and newline characters, respectively.

In other words, the defaults cause [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") to act as follows when reading input:

* Look for line boundaries at newlines.
* Do not skip any line prefix.
* Break lines into fields at tabs.
* Do not expect fields to be enclosed within any quoting characters.

* Interpret characters preceded by the escape character `\` as escape sequences. For example, `\t`, `\n`, and `\\` signify tab, newline, and backslash, respectively. See the discussion of `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` later for the full list of escape sequences.

Conversely, the defaults cause [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") to act as follows when writing output:

* Write tabs between fields.
* Do not enclose fields within any quoting characters.
* Use `\` to escape instances of tab, newline, or `\` that occur within field values.

* Write newlines at the ends of lines.

Note

For a text file generated on a Windows system, proper file reading might require `LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'` because Windows programs typically use two characters as a line terminator. Some programs, such as **WordPad**, might use `\r` as a line terminator when writing files. To read such files, use `LINES TERMINATED BY '\r'`.

If all the input lines have a common prefix that you want to ignore, you can use `LINES STARTING BY 'prefix_string'` to skip the prefix *and anything before it*. If a line does not include the prefix, the entire line is skipped. Suppose that you issue the following statement:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE test
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  LINES STARTING BY 'xxx';
```

If the data file looks like this:

```sql
xxx"abc",1
something xxx"def",2
"ghi",3
```

The resulting rows are `("abc",1)` and `("def",2)`. The third row in the file is skipped because it does not contain the prefix.

The `IGNORE number LINES` clause can be used to ignore lines at the start of the file. For example, you can use `IGNORE 1 LINES` to skip an initial header line containing column names:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/test.txt' INTO TABLE test IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

When you use [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") in tandem with [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") to write data from a database into a file and then read the file back into the database later, the field- and line-handling options for both statements must match. Otherwise, [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") does not interpret the contents of the file properly. Suppose that you use [`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement") to write a file with fields delimited by commas:

```sql
SELECT * INTO OUTFILE 'data.txt'
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
  FROM table2;
```

To read the comma-delimited file, the correct statement is:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
```

If instead you tried to read the file with the statement shown following, it would not work because it instructs [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") to look for tabs between fields:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE table2
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t';
```

The likely result is that each input line would be interpreted as a single field.

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") can be used to read files obtained from external sources. For example, many programs can export data in comma-separated values (CSV) format, such that lines have fields separated by commas and enclosed within double quotation marks, with an initial line of column names. If the lines in such a file are terminated by carriage return/newline pairs, the statement shown here illustrates the field- and line-handling options you would use to load the file:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'data.txt' INTO TABLE tbl_name
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
  IGNORE 1 LINES;
```

If the input values are not necessarily enclosed within quotation marks, use `OPTIONALLY` before the `ENCLOSED BY` option.

Any of the field- or line-handling options can specify an empty string (`''`). If not empty, the `FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY` and `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` values must be a single character. The `FIELDS TERMINATED BY`, `LINES STARTING BY`, and `LINES TERMINATED BY` values can be more than one character. For example, to write lines that are terminated by carriage return/linefeed pairs, or to read a file containing such lines, specify a `LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'` clause.

To read a file containing jokes that are separated by lines consisting of `%%`, you can do this

```sql
CREATE TABLE jokes
  (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  joke TEXT NOT NULL);
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/jokes.txt' INTO TABLE jokes
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ''
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n%%\n' (joke);
```

`FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY` controls quoting of fields. For output ([`SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](select-into.html "13.2.9.1 SELECT ... INTO Statement")), if you omit the word `OPTIONALLY`, all fields are enclosed by the `ENCLOSED BY` character. An example of such output (using a comma as the field delimiter) is shown here:

```sql
"1","a string","100.20"
"2","a string containing a , comma","102.20"
"3","a string containing a \" quote","102.20"
"4","a string containing a \", quote and comma","102.20"
```

If you specify `OPTIONALLY`, the `ENCLOSED BY` character is used only to enclose values from columns that have a string data type (such as [`CHAR`](char.html "11.3.2 The CHAR and VARCHAR Types"), [`BINARY`](binary-varbinary.html "11.3.3 The BINARY and VARBINARY Types"), [`TEXT`](blob.html "11.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types"), or [`ENUM`](enum.html "11.3.5 The ENUM Type")):

```sql
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a \" quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a \", quote and comma",102.20
```

Occurrences of the `ENCLOSED BY` character within a field value are escaped by prefixing them with the `ESCAPED BY` character. Also, if you specify an empty `ESCAPED BY` value, it is possible to inadvertently generate output that cannot be read properly by [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement"). For example, the preceding output just shown would appear as follows if the escape character is empty. Observe that the second field in the fourth line contains a comma following the quote, which (erroneously) appears to terminate the field:

```sql
1,"a string",100.20
2,"a string containing a , comma",102.20
3,"a string containing a " quote",102.20
4,"a string containing a ", quote and comma",102.20
```

For input, the `ENCLOSED BY` character, if present, is stripped from the ends of field values. (This is true regardless of whether `OPTIONALLY` is specified; `OPTIONALLY` has no effect on input interpretation.) Occurrences of the `ENCLOSED BY` character preceded by the `ESCAPED BY` character are interpreted as part of the current field value.

If the field begins with the `ENCLOSED BY` character, instances of that character are recognized as terminating a field value only if followed by the field or line `TERMINATED BY` sequence. To avoid ambiguity, occurrences of the `ENCLOSED BY` character within a field value can be doubled and are interpreted as a single instance of the character. For example, if `ENCLOSED BY '"'` is specified, quotation marks are handled as shown here:

```sql
"The ""BIG"" boss"  -> The "BIG" boss
The "BIG" boss      -> The "BIG" boss
The ""BIG"" boss    -> The ""BIG"" boss
```

`FIELDS ESCAPED BY` controls how to read or write special characters:

* For input, if the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is not empty, occurrences of that character are stripped and the following character is taken literally as part of a field value. Some two-character sequences that are exceptions, where the first character is the escape character. These sequences are shown in the following table (using `\` for the escape character). The rules for `NULL` handling are described later in this section.

  <table summary="Two-character sequences for which the first character (a \) is the escape character."><col style="width: 15%"/><col style="width: 85%"/><thead><tr> <th>Character</th> <th>Escape Sequence</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><code>\0</code></td> <td>An ASCII NUL (<code>X'00'</code>) character</td> </tr><tr> <td><code>\b</code></td> <td>A backspace character</td> </tr><tr> <td><code>\n</code></td> <td>A newline (linefeed) character</td> </tr><tr> <td><code>\r</code></td> <td>A carriage return character</td> </tr><tr> <td><code>\t</code></td> <td>A tab character.</td> </tr><tr> <td><code>\Z</code></td> <td>ASCII 26 (Control+Z)</td> </tr><tr> <td><code>\N</code></td> <td>NULL</td> </tr></tbody></table>

  For more information about `\`-escape syntax, see [Section 9.1.1, “String Literals”](string-literals.html "9.1.1 String Literals").

  If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is empty, escape-sequence interpretation does not occur.

* For output, if the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is not empty, it is used to prefix the following characters on output:

  + The `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character.
  + The `FIELDS [OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY` character.

  + The first character of the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and `LINES TERMINATED BY` values, if the `ENCLOSED BY` character is empty or unspecified.

  + ASCII `0` (what is actually written following the escape character is ASCII `0`, not a zero-valued byte).

  If the `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` character is empty, no characters are escaped and `NULL` is output as `NULL`, not `\N`. It is probably not a good idea to specify an empty escape character, particularly if field values in your data contain any of the characters in the list just given.

In certain cases, field- and line-handling options interact:

* If `LINES TERMINATED BY` is an empty string and `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` is nonempty, lines are also terminated with `FIELDS TERMINATED BY`.

* If the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` values are both empty (`''`), a fixed-row (nondelimited) format is used. With fixed-row format, no delimiters are used between fields (but you can still have a line terminator). Instead, column values are read and written using a field width wide enough to hold all values in the field. For [`TINYINT`](integer-types.html "11.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), [`SMALLINT`](integer-types.html "11.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), [`MEDIUMINT`](integer-types.html "11.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), [`INT`](integer-types.html "11.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), and [`BIGINT`](integer-types.html "11.1.2 Integer Types (Exact Value) - INTEGER, INT, SMALLINT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT"), the field widths are 4, 6, 8, 11, and 20, respectively, no matter what the declared display width is.

  `LINES TERMINATED BY` is still used to separate lines. If a line does not contain all fields, the rest of the columns are set to their default values. If you do not have a line terminator, you should set this to `''`. In this case, the text file must contain all fields for each row.

  Fixed-row format also affects handling of `NULL` values, as described later.

  Note

  Fixed-size format does not work if you are using a multibyte character set.

Handling of `NULL` values varies according to the `FIELDS` and `LINES` options in use:

* For the default `FIELDS` and `LINES` values, `NULL` is written as a field value of `\N` for output, and a field value of `\N` is read as `NULL` for input (assuming that the `ESCAPED BY` character is `\`).

* If `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` is not empty, a field containing the literal word `NULL` as its value is read as a `NULL` value. This differs from the word `NULL` enclosed within `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` characters, which is read as the string `'NULL'`.

* If `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` is empty, `NULL` is written as the word `NULL`.

* With fixed-row format (which is used when `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` are both empty), `NULL` is written as an empty string. This causes both `NULL` values and empty strings in the table to be indistinguishable when written to the file because both are written as empty strings. If you need to be able to tell the two apart when reading the file back in, you should not use fixed-row format.

An attempt to load `NULL` into a `NOT NULL` column produces either a warning or an error according to the rules described in [Column Value Assignment](load-data.html#load-data-column-assignments "Column Value Assignment").

Some cases are not supported by [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement"):

* Fixed-size rows (`FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` both empty) and [`BLOB`](blob.html "11.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") or [`TEXT`](blob.html "11.3.4 The BLOB and TEXT Types") columns.

* If you specify one separator that is the same as or a prefix of another, [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") cannot interpret the input properly. For example, the following `FIELDS` clause would cause problems:

  ```sql
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY '"' ENCLOSED BY '"'
  ```

* If `FIELDS ESCAPED BY` is empty, a field value that contains an occurrence of `FIELDS ENCLOSED BY` or `LINES TERMINATED BY` followed by the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` value causes [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") to stop reading a field or line too early. This happens because [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") cannot properly determine where the field or line value ends.

#### Column List Specification

The following example loads all columns of the `persondata` table:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata;
```

By default, when no column list is provided at the end of the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") statement, input lines are expected to contain a field for each table column. If you want to load only some of a table's columns, specify a column list:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'persondata.txt' INTO TABLE persondata
(col_name_or_user_var [, col_name_or_user_var] ...);
```

You must also specify a column list if the order of the fields in the input file differs from the order of the columns in the table. Otherwise, MySQL cannot tell how to match input fields with table columns.

#### Input Preprocessing

Each instance of *`col_name_or_user_var`* in [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") syntax is either a column name or a user variable. With user variables, the `SET` clause enables you to perform preprocessing transformations on their values before assigning the result to columns.

User variables in the `SET` clause can be used in several ways. The following example uses the first input column directly for the value of `t1.column1`, and assigns the second input column to a user variable that is subjected to a division operation before being used for the value of `t1.column2`:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file.txt'
  INTO TABLE t1
  (column1, @var1)
  SET column2 = @var1/100;
```

The `SET` clause can be used to supply values not derived from the input file. The following statement sets `column3` to the current date and time:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file.txt'
  INTO TABLE t1
  (column1, column2)
  SET column3 = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

You can also discard an input value by assigning it to a user variable and not assigning the variable to any table column:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'file.txt'
  INTO TABLE t1
  (column1, @dummy, column2, @dummy, column3);
```

Use of the column/variable list and `SET` clause is subject to the following restrictions:

* Assignments in the `SET` clause should have only column names on the left hand side of assignment operators.

* You can use subqueries in the right hand side of `SET` assignments. A subquery that returns a value to be assigned to a column may be a scalar subquery only. Also, you cannot use a subquery to select from the table that is being loaded.

* Lines ignored by an `IGNORE number LINES` clause are not processed for the column/variable list or `SET` clause.

* User variables cannot be used when loading data with fixed-row format because user variables do not have a display width.

#### Column Value Assignment

To process an input line, [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") splits it into fields and uses the values according to the column/variable list and the `SET` clause, if they are present. Then the resulting row is inserted into the table. If there are `BEFORE INSERT` or `AFTER INSERT` triggers for the table, they are activated before or after inserting the row, respectively.

Interpretation of field values and assignment to table columns depends on these factors:

* The SQL mode (the value of the [`sql_mode`](server-system-variables.html#sysvar_sql_mode) system variable). The mode can be nonstrictive, or restrictive in various ways. For example, strict SQL mode can be enabled, or the mode can include values such as [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_date) or [`NO_ZERO_IN_DATE`](sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_in_date).

* Presence or absence of the `IGNORE` and `LOCAL` modifiers.

Those factors combine to produce restrictive or nonrestrictive data interpretation by [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement"):

* Data interpretation is restrictive if the SQL mode is restrictive and neither the `IGNORE` nor the `LOCAL` modifier is specified. Errors terminate the load operation.

* Data interpretation is nonrestrictive if the SQL mode is nonrestrictive or the `IGNORE` or `LOCAL` modifier is specified. (In particular, either modifier if specified *overrides* a restrictive SQL mode.) Errors become warnings and the load operation continues.

Restrictive data interpretation uses these rules:

* Too many or too few fields results an error.
* Assigning `NULL` (that is, `\N`) to a non-`NULL` column results in an error.

* A value that is out of range for the column data type results in an error.

* Invalid values produce errors. For example, a value such as `'x'` for a numeric column results in an error, not conversion to 0.

By contrast, nonrestrictive data interpretation uses these rules:

* If an input line has too many fields, the extra fields are ignored and the number of warnings is incremented.

* If an input line has too few fields, the columns for which input fields are missing are assigned their default values. Default value assignment is described in [Section 11.6, “Data Type Default Values”](data-type-defaults.html "11.6 Data Type Default Values").

* Assigning `NULL` (that is, `\N`) to a non-`NULL` column results in assignment of the implicit default value for the column data type. Implicit default values are described in [Section 11.6, “Data Type Default Values”](data-type-defaults.html "11.6 Data Type Default Values").

* Invalid values produce warnings rather than errors, and are converted to the “closest” valid value for the column data type. Examples:

  + A value such as `'x'` for a numeric column results in conversion to 0.

  + An out-of-range numeric or temporal value is clipped to the closest endpoint of the range for the column data type.

  + An invalid value for a `DATETIME`, `DATE`, or `TIME` column is inserted as the implicit default value, regardless of the SQL mode [`NO_ZERO_DATE`](sql-mode.html#sqlmode_no_zero_date) setting. The implicit default is the appropriate “zero” value for the type (`'0000-00-00 00:00:00'`, `'0000-00-00'`, or `'00:00:00'`). See [Section 11.2, “Date and Time Data Types”](date-and-time-types.html "11.2 Date and Time Data Types").

* [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") interprets an empty field value differently from a missing field:

  + For string types, the column is set to the empty string.
  + For numeric types, the column is set to `0`.

  + For date and time types, the column is set to the appropriate “zero” value for the type. See [Section 11.2, “Date and Time Data Types”](date-and-time-types.html "11.2 Date and Time Data Types").

  These are the same values that result if you assign an empty string explicitly to a string, numeric, or date or time type explicitly in an [`INSERT`](insert.html "13.2.5 INSERT Statement") or [`UPDATE`](update.html "13.2.11 UPDATE Statement") statement.

[`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.html "11.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") columns are set to the current date and time only if there is a `NULL` value for the column (that is, `\N`) and the column is not declared to permit `NULL` values, or if the [`TIMESTAMP`](datetime.html "11.2.2 The DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP Types") column default value is the current timestamp and it is omitted from the field list when a field list is specified.

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") regards all input as strings, so you cannot use numeric values for [`ENUM`](enum.html "11.3.5 The ENUM Type") or [`SET`](set.html "11.3.6 The SET Type") columns the way you can with [`INSERT`](insert.html "13.2.5 INSERT Statement") statements. All [`ENUM`](enum.html "11.3.5 The ENUM Type") and [`SET`](set.html "11.3.6 The SET Type") values must be specified as strings.

[`BIT`](bit-type.html "11.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") values cannot be loaded directly using binary notation (for example, `b'011010'`). To work around this, use the `SET` clause to strip off the leading `b'` and trailing `'` and perform a base-2 to base-10 conversion so that MySQL loads the values into the [`BIT`](bit-type.html "11.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") column properly:

```sql
$> cat /tmp/bit_test.txt
b'10'
b'1111111'
$> mysql test
mysql> LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/bit_test.txt'
       INTO TABLE bit_test (@var1)
       SET b = CAST(CONV(MID(@var1, 3, LENGTH(@var1)-3), 2, 10) AS UNSIGNED);
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 2  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT BIN(b+0) FROM bit_test;
+----------+
| BIN(b+0) |
+----------+
| 10       |
| 1111111  |
+----------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

For [`BIT`](bit-type.html "11.1.5 Bit-Value Type - BIT") values in `0b` binary notation (for example, `0b011010`), use this `SET` clause instead to strip off the leading `0b`:

```sql
SET b = CAST(CONV(MID(@var1, 3, LENGTH(@var1)-2), 2, 10) AS UNSIGNED)
```

#### Partitioned Table Support

[`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") supports explicit partition selection using the `PARTITION` clause with a list of one or more comma-separated names of partitions, subpartitions, or both. When this clause is used, if any rows from the file cannot be inserted into any of the partitions or subpartitions named in the list, the statement fails with the error Found a row not matching the given partition set. For more information and examples, see [Section 22.5, “Partition Selection”](partitioning-selection.html "22.5 Partition Selection").

For partitioned tables using storage engines that employ table locks, such as [`MyISAM`](myisam-storage-engine.html "15.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"), [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") cannot prune any partition locks. This does not apply to tables using storage engines that employ row-level locking, such as [`InnoDB`](innodb-storage-engine.html "Chapter 14 The InnoDB Storage Engine"). For more information, see [Section 22.6.4, “Partitioning and Locking”](partitioning-limitations-locking.html "22.6.4 Partitioning and Locking").

#### Concurrency Considerations

With the `LOW_PRIORITY` modifier, execution of the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") statement is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table. This affects only storage engines that use only table-level locking (such as `MyISAM`, `MEMORY`, and `MERGE`).

With the `CONCURRENT` modifier and a `MyISAM` table that satisfies the condition for concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free blocks in the middle), other threads can retrieve data from the table while [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") is executing. This modifier affects the performance of [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") a bit, even if no other thread is using the table at the same time.

#### Statement Result Information

When the [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") statement finishes, it returns an information string in the following format:

```sql
Records: 1  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
```

Warnings occur under the same circumstances as when values are inserted using the [`INSERT`](insert.html "13.2.5 INSERT Statement") statement (see [Section 13.2.5, “INSERT Statement”](insert.html "13.2.5 INSERT Statement")), except that [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") also generates warnings when there are too few or too many fields in the input row.

You can use [`SHOW WARNINGS`](show-warnings.html "13.7.5.40 SHOW WARNINGS Statement") to get a list of the first [`max_error_count`](server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_error_count) warnings as information about what went wrong. See [Section 13.7.5.40, “SHOW WARNINGS Statement”](show-warnings.html "13.7.5.40 SHOW WARNINGS Statement").

If you are using the C API, you can get information about the statement by calling the [`mysql_info()`](/doc/c-api/5.7/en/mysql-info.html) function. See [mysql_info()](/doc/c-api/5.7/en/mysql-info.html).

#### Replication Considerations

For information about [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") in relation to replication, see [Section 16.4.1.18, “Replication and LOAD DATA”](replication-features-load-data.html "16.4.1.18 Replication and LOAD DATA").

#### Miscellaneous Topics

On Unix, if you need [`LOAD DATA`](load-data.html "13.2.6 LOAD DATA Statement") to read from a pipe, you can use the following technique (the example loads a listing of the `/` directory into the table `db1.t1`):

```sql
mkfifo /mysql/data/db1/ls.dat
chmod 666 /mysql/data/db1/ls.dat
find / -ls > /mysql/data/db1/ls.dat &
mysql -e "LOAD DATA INFILE 'ls.dat' INTO TABLE t1" db1
```

Here you must run the command that generates the data to be loaded and the [**mysql**](mysql.html "4.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") commands either on separate terminals, or run the data generation process in the background (as shown in the preceding example). If you do not do this, the pipe blocks until data is read by the [**mysql**](mysql.html "4.5.1 mysql — The MySQL Command-Line Client") process.
