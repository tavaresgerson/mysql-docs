### 13.1.23 DROP EVENT Statement

```sql
DROP EVENT [IF EXISTS] event_name
```

This statement drops the event named *`event_name`*. The event immediately ceases being active, and is deleted completely from the server.

If the event does not exist, the error ERROR 1517 (HY000): Unknown event '*`event_name`*' results. You can override this and cause the statement to generate a warning for nonexistent events instead using `IF EXISTS`.

This statement requires the [`EVENT`](privileges-provided.html#priv_event) privilege for the schema to which the event to be dropped belongs.
