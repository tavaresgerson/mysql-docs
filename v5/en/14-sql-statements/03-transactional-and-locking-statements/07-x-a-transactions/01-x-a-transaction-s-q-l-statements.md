#### 13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements

To perform XA transactions in MySQL, use the following statements:

```sql
XA {START|BEGIN} xid [JOIN|RESUME]

XA END xid [SUSPEND [FOR MIGRATE]]

XA PREPARE xid

XA COMMIT xid [ONE PHASE]

XA ROLLBACK xid

XA RECOVER [CONVERT XID]
```

For [`XA START`](xa-statements.html "13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements"), the `JOIN` and `RESUME` clauses are recognized but have no effect.

For [`XA END`](xa-statements.html "13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") the `SUSPEND [FOR MIGRATE]` clause is recognized but has no effect.

Each XA statement begins with the `XA` keyword, and most of them require an *`xid`* value. An *`xid`* is an XA transaction identifier. It indicates which transaction the statement applies to. *`xid`* values are supplied by the client, or generated by the MySQL server. An *`xid`* value has from one to three parts:

```sql
xid: gtrid [, bqual [, formatID ]]
```

*`gtrid`* is a global transaction identifier, *`bqual`* is a branch qualifier, and *`formatID`* is a number that identifies the format used by the *`gtrid`* and *`bqual`* values. As indicated by the syntax, *`bqual`* and *`formatID`* are optional. The default *`bqual`* value is `''` if not given. The default *`formatID`* value is 1 if not given.

*`gtrid`* and *`bqual`* must be string literals, each up to 64 bytes (not characters) long. *`gtrid`* and *`bqual`* can be specified in several ways. You can use a quoted string (`'ab'`), hex string (`X'6162'`, `0x6162`), or bit value (`b'nnnn'`).

*`formatID`* is an unsigned integer.

The *`gtrid`* and *`bqual`* values are interpreted in bytes by the MySQL server's underlying XA support routines. However, while an SQL statement containing an XA statement is being parsed, the server works with some specific character set. To be safe, write *`gtrid`* and *`bqual`* as hex strings.

*`xid`* values typically are generated by the Transaction Manager. Values generated by one TM must be different from values generated by other TMs. A given TM must be able to recognize its own *`xid`* values in a list of values returned by the [`XA RECOVER`](xa-statements.html "13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement.

[`XA START xid`](xa-statements.html "13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") starts an XA transaction with the given *`xid`* value. Each XA transaction must have a unique *`xid`* value, so the value must not currently be used by another XA transaction. Uniqueness is assessed using the *`gtrid`* and *`bqual`* values. All following XA statements for the XA transaction must be specified using the same *`xid`* value as that given in the [`XA START`](xa-statements.html "13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement. If you use any of those statements but specify an *`xid`* value that does not correspond to some existing XA transaction, an error occurs.

One or more XA transactions can be part of the same global transaction. All XA transactions within a given global transaction must use the same *`gtrid`* value in the *`xid`* value. For this reason, *`gtrid`* values must be globally unique so that there is no ambiguity about which global transaction a given XA transaction is part of. The *`bqual`* part of the *`xid`* value must be different for each XA transaction within a global transaction. (The requirement that *`bqual`* values be different is a limitation of the current MySQL XA implementation. It is not part of the XA specification.)

The [`XA RECOVER`](xa-statements.html "13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") statement returns information for those XA transactions on the MySQL server that are in the `PREPARED` state. (See [Section 13.3.7.2, “XA Transaction States”](xa-states.html "13.3.7.2 XA Transaction States").) The output includes a row for each such XA transaction on the server, regardless of which client started it.

[`XA RECOVER`](xa-statements.html "13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") output rows look like this (for an example *`xid`* value consisting of the parts `'abc'`, `'def'`, and `7`):

```sql
mysql> XA RECOVER;
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+
| formatID | gtrid_length | bqual_length | data   |
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+
|        7 |            3 |            3 | abcdef |
+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+
```

The output columns have the following meanings:

* `formatID` is the *`formatID`* part of the transaction *`xid`*

* `gtrid_length` is the length in bytes of the *`gtrid`* part of the *`xid`*

* `bqual_length` is the length in bytes of the *`bqual`* part of the *`xid`*

* `data` is the concatenation of the *`gtrid`* and *`bqual`* parts of the *`xid`*

XID values may contain nonprintable characters. As of MySQL 5.7.5, [`XA RECOVER`](xa-statements.html "13.3.7.1 XA Transaction SQL Statements") permits an optional `CONVERT XID` clause so that clients can request XID values in hexadecimal.
