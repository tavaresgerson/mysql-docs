This section describes the syntax for the [`BEGIN ... END`](begin-end.html "13.6.1 BEGIN ... END Compound Statement") compound statement and other statements that can be used in the body of stored programs: Stored procedures and functions, triggers, and events. These objects are defined in terms of SQL code that is stored on the server for later invocation (see [Chapter 23, *Stored Objects*](stored-objects.html "Chapter 23 Stored Objects")).

A compound statement is a block that can contain other blocks; declarations for variables, condition handlers, and cursors; and flow control constructs such as loops and conditional tests.
