```sql
BINLOG 'str'
```

[`BINLOG`](binlog.html "13.7.6.1 BINLOG Statement") is an internal-use statement. It is generated by the [**mysqlbinlog**](mysqlbinlog.html "4.6.7 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files") program as the printable representation of certain events in binary log files. (See [Section 4.6.7, “mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files”](mysqlbinlog.html "4.6.7 mysqlbinlog — Utility for Processing Binary Log Files").) The `'str'` value is a base 64-encoded string the that server decodes to determine the data change indicated by the corresponding event. This statement requires the [`SUPER`](privileges-provided.html#priv_super) privilege.

This statement can execute only format description events and row events.
