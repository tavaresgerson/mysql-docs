## 28.9 MySQL Telemetry

The MySQL telemetry component is based on the OpenTelemetry (OTel) project, an open-source, vendor-neutral observability framework providing a common observability standard. It enables users to instrument their applications in order to export observability data: traces, metrics and logs, enabling increased granularity of debugging and testing.

For more information, see Telemetry.
