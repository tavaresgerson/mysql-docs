#### 8.10.3.2 Query Cache SELECT Options

Note

The query cache is deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.20, and is removed in MySQL 8.0.

Two query cache-related options may be specified in `SELECT` statements:

* `SQL_CACHE`

  The query result is cached if it is cacheable and the value of the `query_cache_type` system variable is `ON` or `DEMAND`.

* `SQL_NO_CACHE`

  The server does not use the query cache. It neither checks the query cache to see whether the result is already cached, nor does it cache the query result.

Examples:

```sql
SELECT SQL_CACHE id, name FROM customer;
SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE id, name FROM customer;
```
