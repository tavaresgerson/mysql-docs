#### 25.12.15.7 Table I/O and Lock Wait Summary Tables

The following sections describe the table I/O and lock wait summary tables:

* [`table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-index-usage-table "25.12.15.7.2 The table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage Table"): Table I/O waits per index

* [`table_io_waits_summary_by_table`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-table-table "25.12.15.7.1 The table_io_waits_summary_by_table Table"): Table I/O waits per table

* [`table_lock_waits_summary_by_table`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-lock-waits-summary-by-table-table "25.12.15.7.3 The table_lock_waits_summary_by_table Table"): Table lock waits per table

##### 25.12.15.7.1 The table_io_waits_summary_by_table Table

The [`table_io_waits_summary_by_table`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-table-table "25.12.15.7.1 The table_io_waits_summary_by_table Table") table aggregates all table I/O wait events, as generated by the `wait/io/table/sql/handler` instrument. The grouping is by table.

The [`table_io_waits_summary_by_table`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-table-table "25.12.15.7.1 The table_io_waits_summary_by_table Table") table has these grouping columns to indicate how the table aggregates events: `OBJECT_TYPE`, `OBJECT_SCHEMA`, and `OBJECT_NAME`. These columns have the same meaning as in the [`events_waits_current`](performance-schema-events-waits-current-table.html "25.12.4.1 The events_waits_current Table") table. They identify the table to which the row applies.

[`table_io_waits_summary_by_table`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-table-table "25.12.15.7.1 The table_io_waits_summary_by_table Table") has the following summary columns containing aggregated values. As indicated in the column descriptions, some columns are more general and have values that are the same as the sum of the values of more fine-grained columns. For example, columns that aggregate all writes hold the sum of the corresponding columns that aggregate inserts, updates, and deletes. In this way, aggregations at higher levels are available directly without the need for user-defined views that sum lower-level columns.

* `COUNT_STAR`, `SUM_TIMER_WAIT`, `MIN_TIMER_WAIT`, `AVG_TIMER_WAIT`, `MAX_TIMER_WAIT`

  These columns aggregate all I/O operations. They are the same as the sum of the corresponding `xxx_READ` and `xxx_WRITE` columns.

* `COUNT_READ`, `SUM_TIMER_READ`, `MIN_TIMER_READ`, `AVG_TIMER_READ`, `MAX_TIMER_READ`

  These columns aggregate all read operations. They are the same as the sum of the corresponding `xxx_FETCH` columns.

* `COUNT_WRITE`, `SUM_TIMER_WRITE`, `MIN_TIMER_WRITE`, `AVG_TIMER_WRITE`, `MAX_TIMER_WRITE`

  These columns aggregate all write operations. They are the same as the sum of the corresponding `xxx_INSERT`, `xxx_UPDATE`, and `xxx_DELETE` columns.

* `COUNT_FETCH`, `SUM_TIMER_FETCH`, `MIN_TIMER_FETCH`, `AVG_TIMER_FETCH`, `MAX_TIMER_FETCH`

  These columns aggregate all fetch operations.

* `COUNT_INSERT`, `SUM_TIMER_INSERT`, `MIN_TIMER_INSERT`, `AVG_TIMER_INSERT`, `MAX_TIMER_INSERT`

  These columns aggregate all insert operations.

* `COUNT_UPDATE`, `SUM_TIMER_UPDATE`, `MIN_TIMER_UPDATE`, `AVG_TIMER_UPDATE`, `MAX_TIMER_UPDATE`

  These columns aggregate all update operations.

* `COUNT_DELETE`, `SUM_TIMER_DELETE`, `MIN_TIMER_DELETE`, `AVG_TIMER_DELETE`, `MAX_TIMER_DELETE`

  These columns aggregate all delete operations.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.html "13.1.34 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for table I/O summary tables. It resets the summary columns to zero rather than removing rows. Truncating this table also truncates the [`table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-index-usage-table "25.12.15.7.2 The table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage Table") table.

##### 25.12.15.7.2 The table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage Table

The [`table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-index-usage-table "25.12.15.7.2 The table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage Table") table aggregates all table index I/O wait events, as generated by the `wait/io/table/sql/handler` instrument. The grouping is by table index.

The columns of [`table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-index-usage-table "25.12.15.7.2 The table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage Table") are nearly identical to [`table_io_waits_summary_by_table`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-table-table "25.12.15.7.1 The table_io_waits_summary_by_table Table"). The only difference is the additional group column, `INDEX_NAME`, which corresponds to the name of the index that was used when the table I/O wait event was recorded:

* A value of `PRIMARY` indicates that table I/O used the primary index.

* A value of `NULL` means that table I/O used no index.

* Inserts are counted against `INDEX_NAME = NULL`.

[`TRUNCATE TABLE`](truncate-table.html "13.1.34 TRUNCATE TABLE Statement") is permitted for table I/O summary tables. It resets the summary columns to zero rather than removing rows. This table is also truncated by truncation of the [`table_io_waits_summary_by_table`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-io-waits-summary-by-table-table "25.12.15.7.1 The table_io_waits_summary_by_table Table") table. A DDL operation that changes the index structure of a table may cause the per-index statistics to be reset.

##### 25.12.15.7.3 The table_lock_waits_summary_by_table Table

The [`table_lock_waits_summary_by_table`](performance-schema-table-wait-summary-tables.html#performance-schema-table-lock-waits-summary-by-table-table "25.12.15.7.3 The table_lock_waits_summary_by_table Table") table aggregates all table lock wait events, as generated by the `wait/lock/table/sql/handler` instrument. The grouping is by table.

This table contains information about internal and external locks:

* An internal lock corresponds to a lock in the SQL layer. This is currently implemented by a call to `thr_lock()`. In event rows, these locks are distinguished by the `OPERATION` column, which has one of these values:

  ```sql
  read normal
  read with shared locks
  read high priority
  read no insert
  write allow write
  write concurrent insert
  write delayed
  write low priority
  write normal
  ```

* An external lock corresponds to a lock in the storage engine layer. This is currently implemented by a call to `handler::external_lock()`. In event rows, these locks are distinguished by the `OPERATION` column, which has one of these values:

  ```sql
  read external
  write external
  ```

As indicated in the column descriptions, some columns are more general and have values that are the same as the sum of the values of more fine-grained columns. For example, columns that aggregate all locks hold the sum of the corresponding columns that aggregate read and write locks. In this way, aggregations at higher levels are available directly without the need for user-defined views that sum lower-level columns.

* `COUNT_STAR`, `SUM_TIMER_WAIT`, `MIN_TIMER_WAIT`, `AVG_TIMER_WAIT`, `MAX_TIMER_WAIT`

  These columns aggregate all lock operations. They are the same as the sum of the corresponding `xxx_READ` and `xxx_WRITE` columns.
