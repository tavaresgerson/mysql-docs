#### 16.4.1.21 Replication of the mysql System Database

Data modification statements made to tables in the `mysql` database are replicated according to the value of [`binlog_format`](replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_format); if this value is `MIXED`, these statements are replicated using row-based format. However, statements that would normally update this information indirectly—such [`GRANT`](grant.html "13.7.1.4 GRANT Statement"), [`REVOKE`](revoke.html "13.7.1.6 REVOKE Statement"), and statements manipulating triggers, stored routines, and views—are replicated to replicas using statement-based replication.
