#### 16.4.1.24 Replication and REPAIR TABLE

When used on a corrupted or otherwise damaged table, it is possible for the [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.html "13.7.2.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") statement to delete rows that cannot be recovered. However, any such modifications of table data performed by this statement are not replicated, which can cause source and replica to lose synchronization. For this reason, in the event that a table on the source becomes damaged and you use [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.html "13.7.2.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement") to repair it, you should first stop replication (if it is still running) before using [`REPAIR TABLE`](repair-table.html "13.7.2.5 REPAIR TABLE Statement"), then afterward compare the source's and replica's copies of the table and be prepared to correct any discrepancies manually, before restarting replication.
