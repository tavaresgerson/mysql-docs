### 16.3.7 Switching Sources During Failover

You can tell a replica to change to a new source using the [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.html "13.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement. The replica does not check whether the databases on the source are compatible with those on the replica; it simply begins reading and executing events from the specified coordinates in the new source's binary log. In a failover situation, all the servers in the group are typically executing the same events from the same binary log file, so changing the source of the events should not affect the structure or integrity of the database, provided that you exercise care in making the change.

Replicas should be run with binary logging enabled (the [`--log-bin`](replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin) option), which is the default. If you are not using GTIDs for replication, then the replicas should also be run with [`--log-slave-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_slave_updates) (logging replica updates is the default). In this way, the replica is ready to become a source without restarting the replica [**mysqld**](mysqld.html "4.3.1 mysqld — The MySQL Server"). Assume that you have the structure shown in [Figure 16.4, “Redundancy Using Replication, Initial Structure”](replication-solutions-switch.html#figure_replication-redundancy-before "Figure 16.4 Redundancy Using Replication, Initial Structure").

In this diagram, the `Source` holds the source database, the `Replica*` hosts are replicas, and the `Web Client` machines are issuing database reads and writes. Web clients that issue only reads (and would normally be connected to the replicas) are not shown, as they do not need to switch to a new server in the event of failure. For a more detailed example of a read/write scale-out replication structure, see [Section 16.3.4, “Using Replication for Scale-Out”](replication-solutions-scaleout.html "16.3.4 Using Replication for Scale-Out").

Each MySQL replica (`Replica 1`, `Replica 2`, and `Replica 3`) is a replica running with binary logging enabled, and with [`--log-slave-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_slave_updates). Because updates received by a replica from the source are not written to the binary log when [`--log-slave-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_slave_updates) is specified, the binary log on each replica is initially empty. If for some reason `Source` becomes unavailable, you can pick one of the replicas to become the new source. For example, if you pick `Replica 1`, all `Web Clients` should be redirected to `Replica 1`, which writes the updates to its binary log. `Replica 2` and `Replica 3` should then replicate from `Replica 1`.

The reason for running the replica with [`--log-slave-updates=OFF`](replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_slave_updates) is to prevent replicas from receiving updates twice in case you cause one of the replicas to become the new source. If `Replica 1` has [`--log-slave-updates`](replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_slave_updates) enabled, which is the default, it writes any updates that it receives from `Source` in its own binary log. This means that, when `Replica 2` changes from `Source` to `Replica 1` as its source, it may receive updates from `Replica 1` that it has already received from `Source`.

Make sure that all replicas have processed any statements in their relay log. On each replica, issue `STOP SLAVE IO_THREAD`, then check the output of [`SHOW PROCESSLIST`](show-processlist.html "13.7.5.29 SHOW PROCESSLIST Statement") until you see `Has read all relay log`. When this is true for all replicas, they can be reconfigured to the new setup. On the replica `Replica 1` being promoted to become the source, issue [`STOP SLAVE`](stop-slave.html "13.4.2.6 STOP SLAVE Statement") and [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.html "13.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement").

On the other replicas `Replica 2` and `Replica 3`, use [`STOP SLAVE`](stop-slave.html "13.4.2.6 STOP SLAVE Statement") and `CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='Replica1'` (where `'Replica1'` represents the real host name of `Replica 1`). To use `CHANGE MASTER TO`, add all information about how to connect to `Replica 1` from `Replica 2` or `Replica 3` (*`user`*, *`password`*, *`port`*). When issuing the statement in this scenario, there is no need to specify the name of the `Replica 1` binary log file or log position to read from, since the first binary log file and position 4 are the defaults. Finally, execute [`START SLAVE`](start-slave.html "13.4.2.5 START SLAVE Statement") on `Replica 2` and `Replica 3`.

Once the new replication setup is in place, you need to tell each `Web Client` to direct its statements to `Replica 1`. From that point on, all updates sent by `Web Client` to `Replica 1` are written to the binary log of `Replica 1`, which then contains every update sent to `Replica 1` since `Source` became unavailable.

The resulting server structure is shown in [Figure 16.5, “Redundancy Using Replication, After Source Failure”](replication-solutions-switch.html#figure_replication-redundancy-after "Figure 16.5 Redundancy Using Replication, After Source Failure").

**Figure 16.5 Redundancy Using Replication, After Source Failure**

When `Source` becomes available again, you should make it a replica of `Replica 1`. To do this, issue on `Source` the same [`CHANGE MASTER TO`](change-master-to.html "13.4.2.1 CHANGE MASTER TO Statement") statement as that issued on `Replica 2` and `Replica 3` previously. `Source` then becomes a replica of `Replica 1` and picks up the `Web Client` writes that it missed while it was offline.

To make `Source` a source again, use the preceding procedure as if `Replica 1` were unavailable and `Source` were to be the new source. During this procedure, do not forget to run [`RESET MASTER`](reset-master.html "13.4.1.2 RESET MASTER Statement") on `Source` before making `Replica 1`, `Replica 2`, and `Replica 3` replicas of `Source`. If you fail to do this, the replicas may pick up stale writes from the `Web Client` applications dating from before the point at which `Source` became unavailable.

You should be aware that there is no synchronization between replicas, even when they share the same source, and thus some replicas might be considerably ahead of others. This means that in some cases the procedure outlined in the previous example might not work as expected. In practice, however, relay logs on all replicas should be relatively close together.

One way to keep applications informed about the location of the source is to have a dynamic DNS entry for the source host. With `BIND`, you can use **nsupdate** to update the DNS dynamically.
