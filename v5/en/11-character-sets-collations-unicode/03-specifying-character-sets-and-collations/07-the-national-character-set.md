### 10.3.7 The National Character Set

Standard SQL defines `NCHAR` or `NATIONAL CHAR` as a way to indicate that a `CHAR` column should use some predefined character set. MySQL uses `utf8` as this predefined character set. For example, these data type declarations are equivalent:

```sql
CHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
NATIONAL CHARACTER(10)
NCHAR(10)
```

As are these:

```sql
VARCHAR(10) CHARACTER SET utf8
NATIONAL VARCHAR(10)
NVARCHAR(10)
NCHAR VARCHAR(10)
NATIONAL CHARACTER VARYING(10)
NATIONAL CHAR VARYING(10)
```

You can use `N'literal'` (or `n'literal'`) to create a string in the national character set. These statements are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT N'some text';
SELECT n'some text';
SELECT _utf8'some text';
```
