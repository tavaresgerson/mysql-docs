### 27.3.3 JavaScript Stored Program Language Support

JavaScript language support in MySQL conforms to the ECMAScript 2024 Specification, and uses strict mode by default. Strict mode cannot be disabled. This implementation includes all of the standard ECMAScript library objects such as `Object`, `Function`, `Math`, `Date`, `String`, and so forth. `console.log()` and `console.error()` are also supported (see Section 27.3.12, “JavaScript Stored Program Examples”).
