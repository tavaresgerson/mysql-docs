### 28.7.2 The INFORMATION_SCHEMA MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS Table

The `MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS` table provides a view into the in-memory data cache for the MySQL Enterprise Firewall plugin. It lists names and operational modes of registered firewall account profiles. It is used in conjunction with the `mysql.firewall_users` system table that provides persistent storage of firewall data; see MySQL Enterprise Firewall Tables.

The `MYSQL_FIREWALL_USERS` table has these columns:

* `USERHOST`

  The account profile name. Each account name has the format `user_name@host_name`.

* `MODE`

  The current operational mode for the profile. Permitted mode values are `OFF`, `DETECTING`, `PROTECTING`, `RECORDING`, and `RESET`. For details about their meanings, see Firewall Concepts.

This table is deprecated and subject to removal in a future MySQL version. See Migrating Account Profiles to Group Profiles.
