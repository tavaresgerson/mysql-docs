### 15.1.41 RENAME TABLE Statement

```
RENAME TABLE
    tbl_name TO new_tbl_name
    [, tbl_name2 TO new_tbl_name2] ...
```

`RENAME TABLE` renames one or more tables. You must have `ALTER` and `DROP` privileges for the original table, and `CREATE` and `INSERT` privileges for the new table.

For example, to rename a table named `old_table` to `new_table`, use this statement:

```
RENAME TABLE old_table TO new_table;
```

That statement is equivalent to the following `ALTER TABLE` statement:

```
ALTER TABLE old_table RENAME new_table;
```

`RENAME TABLE`, unlike `ALTER TABLE`, can rename multiple tables within a single statement:

```
RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             old_table2 TO new_table2,
             old_table3 TO new_table3;
```

Renaming operations are performed left to right. Thus, to swap two table names, do this (assuming that a table with the intermediary name `tmp_table` does not already exist):

```
RENAME TABLE old_table TO tmp_table,
             new_table TO old_table,
             tmp_table TO new_table;
```

Metadata locks on tables are acquired in name order, which in some cases can make a difference in operation outcome when multiple transactions execute concurrently. See Section 10.11.4, “Metadata Locking”.

You can rename tables locked with a `LOCK TABLES` statement, provided that they are locked with a `WRITE` lock or are the product of renaming `WRITE`-locked tables from earlier steps in a multiple-table rename operation. For example, this is permitted:

```
LOCK TABLE old_table1 WRITE;
RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             new_table1 TO new_table2;
```

This is not permitted:

```
LOCK TABLE old_table1 READ;
RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             new_table1 TO new_table2;
```

With the transaction table locking conditions satisfied, the rename operation is done atomically; no other session can access any of the tables while the rename is in progress.

If any errors occur during a `RENAME TABLE`, the statement fails and no changes are made.

You can use `RENAME TABLE` to move a table from one database to another:

```
RENAME TABLE current_db.tbl_name TO other_db.tbl_name;
```

Using this method to move all tables from one database to a different one in effect renames the database (an operation for which MySQL has no single statement), except that the original database continues to exist, albeit with no tables.

Like `RENAME TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` can also be used to move a table to a different database. Regardless of the statement used, if the rename operation would move the table to a database located on a different file system, the success of the outcome is platform specific and depends on the underlying operating system calls used to move table files.

If a table has triggers, attempts to rename the table into a different database fail with a Trigger in wrong schema (`ER_TRG_IN_WRONG_SCHEMA`) error.

An unencrypted table can be moved to an encryption-enabled database and vice versa. However, if the `table_encryption_privilege_check` variable is enabled, the `TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN` privilege is required if the table encryption setting differs from the default database encryption.

To rename `TEMPORARY` tables, `RENAME TABLE` does not work. Use `ALTER TABLE` instead.

`RENAME TABLE` works for views, except that views cannot be renamed into a different database.

Any privileges granted specifically for a renamed table or view are not migrated to the new name. They must be changed manually.

`RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_tbl_name` changes internally generated foreign key constraint names and user-defined foreign key constraint names that begin with the string “*`tbl_name`*_ibfk_” to reflect the new table name. `InnoDB` interprets foreign key constraint names that begin with the string “*`tbl_name`*_ibfk_” as internally generated names.

Foreign key constraint names that point to the renamed table are automatically updated unless there is a conflict, in which case the statement fails with an error. A conflict occurs if the renamed constraint name already exists. In such cases, you must drop and re-create the foreign keys for them to function properly.

`RENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_tbl_name` changes internally generated and user-defined `CHECK` constraint names that begin with the string “*`tbl_name`*_chk_” to reflect the new table name. MySQL interprets `CHECK` constraint names that begin with the string “*`tbl_name`*_chk_” as internally generated names. Example:

```
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE t1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: t1
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `t1` (
  `i1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `i2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT `t1_chk_1` CHECK ((`i1` > 0)),
  CONSTRAINT `t1_chk_2` CHECK ((`i2` < 0))
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.02 sec)

mysql> RENAME TABLE t1 TO t3;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE t3\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: t3
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `t3` (
  `i1` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `i2` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT `t3_chk_1` CHECK ((`i1` > 0)),
  CONSTRAINT `t3_chk_2` CHECK ((`i2` < 0))
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```
