Normally, you create all indexes on a table at the time the table itself is created with `CREATE TABLE`. See Section 15.1.24, “CREATE TABLE Statement”. This guideline is especially important for `InnoDB` tables, where the primary key determines the physical layout of rows in the data file. `CREATE INDEX` enables you to add indexes to existing tables.

`CREATE INDEX` is mapped to an `ALTER TABLE` statement to create indexes. See Section 15.1.11, “ALTER TABLE Statement”. `CREATE INDEX` cannot be used to create a `PRIMARY KEY`; use `ALTER TABLE` instead. For more information about indexes, see Section 10.3.1, “How MySQL Uses Indexes”.

`InnoDB` supports secondary indexes on virtual columns. For more information, see Section 15.1.24.9, “Secondary Indexes and Generated Columns”.

When the `innodb_stats_persistent` setting is enabled, run the `ANALYZE TABLE` statement for an `InnoDB` table after creating an index on that table.

The *`expr`* for a *`key_part`* specification can also take the form `(CAST json_expression AS type ARRAY)` to create a multi-valued index on a `JSON` column. See Multi-Valued Indexes.

An index specification of the form `(key_part1, key_part2, ...)` creates an index with multiple key parts. Index key values are formed by concatenating the values of the given key parts. For example `(col1, col2, col3)` specifies a multiple-column index with index keys consisting of values from `col1`, `col2`, and `col3`.

A *`key_part`* specification can end with `ASC` or `DESC` to specify whether index values are stored in ascending or descending order. The default is ascending if no order specifier is given.

`ASC` and `DESC` are not supported for `HASH` indexes, multi-valued indexes or `SPATIAL` indexes.

The following sections describe different aspects of the `CREATE INDEX` statement:

* Column Prefix Key Parts
* Functional Key Parts
* Unique Indexes
* Full-Text Indexes
* Multi-Valued Indexes
* Spatial Indexes
* Index Options
* Table Copying and Locking Options

#### Column Prefix Key Parts

For string columns, indexes can be created that use only the leading part of column values, using `col_name(length)` syntax to specify an index prefix length:

* Prefixes can be specified for `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `BINARY`, and `VARBINARY` key parts.

* Prefixes *must* be specified for `BLOB` and `TEXT` key parts. Additionally, `BLOB` and `TEXT` columns can be indexed only for `InnoDB`, `MyISAM`, and `BLACKHOLE` tables.

* Prefix *limits* are measured in bytes. However, prefix *lengths* for index specifications in `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `CREATE INDEX` statements are interpreted as number of characters for nonbinary string types (`CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`) and number of bytes for binary string types (`BINARY`, `VARBINARY`, `BLOB`). Take this into account when specifying a prefix length for a nonbinary string column that uses a multibyte character set.

  Prefix support and lengths of prefixes (where supported) are storage engine dependent. For example, a prefix can be up to 767 bytes long for `InnoDB` tables that use the `REDUNDANT` or `COMPACT` row format. The prefix length limit is 3072 bytes for `InnoDB` tables that use the `DYNAMIC` or `COMPRESSED` row format. For `MyISAM` tables, the prefix length limit is 1000 bytes. The `NDB` storage engine does not support prefixes (see Section 25.2.7.6, “Unsupported or Missing Features in NDB Cluster”).

If a specified index prefix exceeds the maximum column data type size, `CREATE INDEX` handles the index as follows:

* For a nonunique index, either an error occurs (if strict SQL mode is enabled), or the index length is reduced to lie within the maximum column data type size and a warning is produced (if strict SQL mode is not enabled).

* For a unique index, an error occurs regardless of SQL mode because reducing the index length might enable insertion of nonunique entries that do not meet the specified uniqueness requirement.

The statement shown here creates an index using the first 10 characters of the `name` column (assuming that `name` has a nonbinary string type):

```
CREATE INDEX part_of_name ON customer (name(10));
```

If names in the column usually differ in the first 10 characters, lookups performed using this index should not be much slower than using an index created from the entire `name` column. Also, using column prefixes for indexes can make the index file much smaller, which could save a lot of disk space and might also speed up `INSERT` operations.

#### Functional Key Parts

A “normal” index indexes column values or prefixes of column values. For example, in the following table, the index entry for a given `t1` row includes the full `col1` value and a prefix of the `col2` value consisting of its first 10 characters:

```
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  col1 VARCHAR(10),
  col2 VARCHAR(20),
  INDEX (col1, col2(10))
);
```

Functional key parts that index expression values canalso be used in place of column or column prefix values. Use of functional key parts enables indexing of values not stored directly in the table. Examples:

```
CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 INT, col2 INT, INDEX func_index ((ABS(col1))));
CREATE INDEX idx1 ON t1 ((col1 + col2));
CREATE INDEX idx2 ON t1 ((col1 + col2), (col1 - col2), col1);
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD INDEX ((col1 * 40) DESC);
```

An index with multiple key parts can mix nonfunctional and functional key parts.

`ASC` and `DESC` are supported for functional key parts.

Functional key parts must adhere to the following rules. An error occurs if a key part definition contains disallowed constructs.

* In index definitions, enclose expressions within parentheses to distinguish them from columns or column prefixes. For example, this is permitted; the expressions are enclosed within parentheses:

  ```
  INDEX ((col1 + col2), (col3 - col4))
  ```

  This produces an error; the expressions are not enclosed within parentheses:

  ```
  INDEX (col1 + col2, col3 - col4)
  ```

* A functional key part cannot consist solely of a column name. For example, this is not permitted:

  ```
  INDEX ((col1), (col2))
  ```

  Instead, write the key parts as nonfunctional key parts, without parentheses:

  ```
  INDEX (col1, col2)
  ```

* A functional key part expression cannot refer to column prefixes. For a workaround, see the discussion of `SUBSTRING()` and `CAST()` later in this section.

* Functional key parts are not permitted in foreign key specifications.

For `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE`, the destination table preserves functional key parts from the original table.

Functional indexes are implemented as hidden virtual generated columns, which has these implications:

* Each functional key part counts against the limit on total number of table columns; see Section 10.4.7, “Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size”.

* Functional key parts inherit all restrictions that apply to generated columns. Examples:

  + Only functions permitted for generated columns are permitted for functional key parts.

  + Subqueries, parameters, variables, stored functions, and loadable functions are not permitted.

  For more information about applicable restrictions, see Section 15.1.24.8, “CREATE TABLE and Generated Columns”, and Section 15.1.11.2, “ALTER TABLE and Generated Columns”.

* The virtual generated column itself requires no storage. The index itself takes up storage space as any other index.

`UNIQUE` is supported for indexes that include functional key parts. However, primary keys cannot include functional key parts. A primary key requires the generated column to be stored, but functional key parts are implemented as virtual generated columns, not stored generated columns.

`SPATIAL` and `FULLTEXT` indexes cannot have functional key parts.

If a table contains no primary key, `InnoDB` automatically promotes the first `UNIQUE NOT NULL` index to the primary key. This is not supported for `UNIQUE NOT NULL` indexes that have functional key parts.

Nonfunctional indexes raise a warning if there are duplicate indexes. Indexes that contain functional key parts do not have this feature.

To remove a column that is referenced by a functional key part, the index must be removed first. Otherwise, an error occurs.

Although nonfunctional key parts support a prefix length specification, this is not possible for functional key parts. The solution is to use `SUBSTRING()` (or `CAST()`, as described later in this section). For a functional key part containing the `SUBSTRING()` function to be used in a query, the `WHERE` clause must contain `SUBSTRING()` with the same arguments. In the following example, only the second `SELECT` is able to use the index because that is the only query in which the arguments to `SUBSTRING()` match the index specification:

```
CREATE TABLE tbl (
  col1 LONGTEXT,
  INDEX idx1 ((SUBSTRING(col1, 1, 10)))
);
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE SUBSTRING(col1, 1, 9) = '123456789';
SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE SUBSTRING(col1, 1, 10) = '1234567890';
```

Functional key parts enable indexing of values that cannot be indexed otherwise, such as `JSON` values. However, this must be done correctly to achieve the desired effect. For example, this syntax does not work:

```
CREATE TABLE employees (
  data JSON,
  INDEX ((data->>'$.name'))
);
```

The syntax fails because:

* The `->>` operator translates into `JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(...))`.

* `JSON_UNQUOTE()` returns a value with a data type of `LONGTEXT`, and the hidden generated column thus is assigned the same data type.

* MySQL cannot index `LONGTEXT` columns specified without a prefix length on the key part, and prefix lengths are not permitted in functional key parts.

To index the `JSON` column, you could try using the `CAST()` function as follows:

```
CREATE TABLE employees (
  data JSON,
  INDEX ((CAST(data->>'$.name' AS CHAR(30))))
);
```

The hidden generated column is assigned the `VARCHAR(30)` data type, which can be indexed. But this approach produces a new issue when trying to use the index:

* `CAST()` returns a string with the collation `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` (the server default collation).

* `JSON_UNQUOTE()` returns a string with the collation `utf8mb4_bin` (hard coded).

As a result, there is a collation mismatch between the indexed expression in the preceding table definition and the `WHERE` clause expression in the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE data->>'$.name' = 'James';
```

The index is not used because the expressions in the query and the index differ. To support this kind of scenario for functional key parts, the optimizer automatically strips `CAST()` when looking for an index to use, but *only* if the collation of the indexed expression matches that of the query expression. For an index with a functional key part to be used, either of the following two solutions work (although they differ somewhat in effect):

* Solution 1. Assign the indexed expression the same collation as `JSON_UNQUOTE()`:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE employees (
    data JSON,
    INDEX idx ((CAST(data->>"$.name" AS CHAR(30)) COLLATE utf8mb4_bin))
  );
  INSERT INTO employees VALUES
    ('{ "name": "james", "salary": 9000 }'),
    ('{ "name": "James", "salary": 10000 }'),
    ('{ "name": "Mary", "salary": 12000 }'),
    ('{ "name": "Peter", "salary": 8000 }');
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE data->>'$.name' = 'James';
  ```

  The `->>` operator is the same as `JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(...))`, and `JSON_UNQUOTE()` returns a string with collation `utf8mb4_bin`. The comparison is thus case-sensitive, and only one row matches:

  ```
  +------------------------------------+
  | data                               |
  +------------------------------------+
  | {"name": "James", "salary": 10000} |
  +------------------------------------+
  ```

* Solution 2. Specify the full expression in the query:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE employees (
    data JSON,
    INDEX idx ((CAST(data->>"$.name" AS CHAR(30))))
  );
  INSERT INTO employees VALUES
    ('{ "name": "james", "salary": 9000 }'),
    ('{ "name": "James", "salary": 10000 }'),
    ('{ "name": "Mary", "salary": 12000 }'),
    ('{ "name": "Peter", "salary": 8000 }');
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE CAST(data->>'$.name' AS CHAR(30)) = 'James';
  ```

  `CAST()` returns a string with collation `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`, so the comparison case-insensitive and two rows match:

  ```
  +------------------------------------+
  | data                               |
  +------------------------------------+
  | {"name": "james", "salary": 9000}  |
  | {"name": "James", "salary": 10000} |
  +------------------------------------+
  ```

Be aware that although the optimizer supports automatically stripping `CAST()` with indexed generated columns, the following approach does not work because it produces a different result with and without an index (Bug#27337092):

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE employees (
         data JSON,
         generated_col VARCHAR(30) AS (CAST(data->>'$.name' AS CHAR(30)))
       );
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.03 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO employees (data)
       VALUES ('{"name": "james"}'), ('{"name": "James"}');
Query OK, 2 rows affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM employees WHERE data->>'$.name' = 'James';
+-------------------+---------------+
| data              | generated_col |
+-------------------+---------------+
| {"name": "James"} | James         |
+-------------------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> ALTER TABLE employees ADD INDEX idx (generated_col);
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.03 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 1

mysql> SELECT * FROM employees WHERE data->>'$.name' = 'James';
+-------------------+---------------+
| data              | generated_col |
+-------------------+---------------+
| {"name": "james"} | james         |
| {"name": "James"} | James         |
+-------------------+---------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

#### Unique Indexes

A `UNIQUE` index creates a constraint such that all values in the index must be distinct. An error occurs if you try to add a new row with a key value that matches an existing row. If you specify a prefix value for a column in a `UNIQUE` index, the column values must be unique within the prefix length. A `UNIQUE` index permits multiple `NULL` values for columns that can contain `NULL`.

If a table has a `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE NOT NULL` index that consists of a single column that has an integer type, you can use `_rowid` to refer to the indexed column in `SELECT` statements, as follows:

* `_rowid` refers to the `PRIMARY KEY` column if there is a `PRIMARY KEY` consisting of a single integer column. If there is a `PRIMARY KEY` but it does not consist of a single integer column, `_rowid` cannot be used.

* Otherwise, `_rowid` refers to the column in the first `UNIQUE NOT NULL` index if that index consists of a single integer column. If the first `UNIQUE NOT NULL` index does not consist of a single integer column, `_rowid` cannot be used.

#### Full-Text Indexes

`FULLTEXT` indexes are supported only for `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` tables and can include only `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, and `TEXT` columns. Indexing always happens over the entire column; column prefix indexing is not supported and any prefix length is ignored if specified. See Section 14.9, “Full-Text Search Functions”, for details of operation.

#### Multi-Valued Indexes

`InnoDB` supports multi-valued indexes. A multi-valued index is a secondary index defined on a column that stores an array of values. A “normal” index has one index record for each data record (1:1). A multi-valued index can have multiple index records for a single data record (N:1). Multi-valued indexes are intended for indexing `JSON` arrays. For example, a multi-valued index defined on the array of zip codes in the following JSON document creates an index record for each zip code, with each index record referencing the same data record.

```
{
    "user":"Bob",
    "user_id":31,
    "zipcode":[94477,94536]
}
```

##### Creating multi-valued Indexes

You can create a multi-valued index in a `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, or `CREATE INDEX` statement. This requires using `CAST(... AS ... ARRAY)` in the index definition, which casts same-typed scalar values in a `JSON` array to an SQL data type array. A virtual column is then generated transparently with the values in the SQL data type array; finally, a functional index (also referred to as a virtual index) is created on the virtual column. It is the functional index defined on the virtual column of values from the SQL data type array that forms the multi-valued index.

The examples in the following list show the three different ways in which a multi-valued index `zips` can be created on an array `$.zipcode` on a `JSON` column `custinfo` in a table named `customers`. In each case, the JSON array is cast to an SQL data type array of `UNSIGNED` integer values.

* `CREATE TABLE` only:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      modified DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      custinfo JSON,
      INDEX zips( (CAST(custinfo->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY)) )
      );
  ```

* `CREATE TABLE` plus `ALTER TABLE`:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      modified DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      custinfo JSON
      );

  ALTER TABLE customers ADD INDEX zips( (CAST(custinfo->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY)) );
  ```

* `CREATE TABLE` plus `CREATE INDEX`:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE customers (
      id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      modified DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      custinfo JSON
      );

  CREATE INDEX zips ON customers ( (CAST(custinfo->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY)) );
  ```

A multi-valued index can also be defined as part of a composite index. This example shows a composite index that includes two single-valued parts (for the `id` and `modified` columns), and one multi-valued part (for the `custinfo` column):

```
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    modified DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    custinfo JSON
    );

ALTER TABLE customers ADD INDEX comp(id, modified,
    (CAST(custinfo->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY)) );
```

Only one multi-valued key part can be used in a composite index. The multi-valued key part may be used in any order relative to the other parts of the key. In other words, the `ALTER TABLE` statement just shown could have used `comp(id, (CAST(custinfo->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY), modified))` (or any other ordering) and still have been valid.

##### Using multi-valued Indexes

The optimizer uses a multi-valued index to fetch records when the following functions are specified in a `WHERE` clause:

* `MEMBER OF()`
* `JSON_CONTAINS()`
* `JSON_OVERLAPS()`

We can demonstrate this by creating and populating the `customers` table using the following `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements:

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE customers (
    ->     id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     modified DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ->     custinfo JSON
    ->     );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.51 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO customers VALUES
    ->     (NULL, NOW(), '{"user":"Jack","user_id":37,"zipcode":[94582,94536]}'),
    ->     (NULL, NOW(), '{"user":"Jill","user_id":22,"zipcode":[94568,94507,94582]}'),
    ->     (NULL, NOW(), '{"user":"Bob","user_id":31,"zipcode":[94477,94507]}'),
    ->     (NULL, NOW(), '{"user":"Mary","user_id":72,"zipcode":[94536]}'),
    ->     (NULL, NOW(), '{"user":"Ted","user_id":56,"zipcode":[94507,94582]}');
Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.07 sec)
Records: 5  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

First we execute three queries on the `customers` table, one each using `MEMBER OF()`, `JSON_CONTAINS()`, and `JSON_OVERLAPS()`, with the result from each query shown here:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM customers
    ->     WHERE 94507 MEMBER OF(custinfo->'$.zipcode');
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id | modified            | custinfo                                                          |
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  2 | 2019-06-29 22:23:12 | {"user": "Jill", "user_id": 22, "zipcode": [94568, 94507, 94582]} |

|  5 | 2019-06-29 22:23:12 | {"user": "Ted", "user_id": 56, "zipcode": [94507, 94582]}         |
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM customers
    ->     WHERE JSON_CONTAINS(custinfo->'$.zipcode', CAST('[94507,94582]' AS JSON));
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id | modified            | custinfo                                                          |
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  2 | 2019-06-29 22:23:12 | {"user": "Jill", "user_id": 22, "zipcode": [94568, 94507, 94582]} |
|  5 | 2019-06-29 22:23:12 | {"user": "Ted", "user_id": 56, "zipcode": [94507, 94582]}         |
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM customers
    ->     WHERE JSON_OVERLAPS(custinfo->'$.zipcode', CAST('[94507,94582]' AS JSON));
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id | modified            | custinfo                                                          |
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  1 | 2019-06-29 22:23:12 | {"user": "Jack", "user_id": 37, "zipcode": [94582, 94536]}        |
|  2 | 2019-06-29 22:23:12 | {"user": "Jill", "user_id": 22, "zipcode": [94568, 94507, 94582]} |
|  3 | 2019-06-29 22:23:12 | {"user": "Bob", "user_id": 31, "zipcode": [94477, 94507]}         |
|  5 | 2019-06-29 22:23:12 | {"user": "Ted", "user_id": 56, "zipcode": [94507, 94582]}         |
+----+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Next, we run `EXPLAIN` on each of the previous three queries:

```
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers
    ->     WHERE 94507 MEMBER OF(custinfo->'$.zipcode');
+----+-------------+-----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+

+----+-------------+-----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers
    ->     WHERE JSON_CONTAINS(custinfo->'$.zipcode', CAST('[94507,94582]' AS JSON));
+----+-------------+-----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+

+----+-------------+-----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)

mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers
    ->     WHERE JSON_OVERLAPS(custinfo->'$.zipcode', CAST('[94507,94582]' AS JSON));
+----+-------------+-----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+
| id | select_type | table     | partitions | type | possible_keys | key  | key_len | ref  | rows | filtered | Extra       |
+----+-------------+-----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+

+----+-------------+-----------+------------+------+---------------+------+---------+------+------+----------+-------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.01 sec)
```

None of the three queries just shown are able to use any keys. To solve this problem, we can add a multi-valued index on the `zipcode` array in the `JSON` column (`custinfo`), like this:

```
mysql> ALTER TABLE customers
    ->     ADD INDEX zips( (CAST(custinfo->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY)) );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.47 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

When we run the previous `EXPLAIN` statements again, we can now observe that the queries can (and do) use the index `zips` that was just created:

```
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers
    ->     WHERE 94507 MEMBER OF(custinfo->'$.zipcode');

A multi-valued index can be defined as a unique key. If defined as a unique key, attempting to insert a value already present in the multi-valued index returns a duplicate key error. If duplicate values are already present, attempting to add a unique multi-valued index fails, as shown here:

```
mysql> ALTER TABLE customers DROP INDEX zips;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.55 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> ALTER TABLE customers
    ->     ADD UNIQUE INDEX zips((CAST(custinfo->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY)));
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '[94507, ' for key 'customers.zips'
mysql> ALTER TABLE customers
    ->     ADD INDEX zips((CAST(custinfo->'$.zipcode' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY)));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.36 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

##### Characteristics of Multi-Valued Indexes

Multi-valued indexes have the additional characteristics listed here:

* DML operations that affect multi-valued indexes are handled in the same way as DML operations that affect a normal index, with the only difference being that there may be more than one insert or update for a single clustered index record.

* Nullability and multi-valued indexes:

  + If a multi-valued key part has an empty array, no entries are added to the index, and the data record is not accessible by an index scan.

  + If multi-valued key part generation returns a `NULL` value, a single entry containing `NULL` is added to the multi-valued index. If the key part is defined as `NOT NULL`, an error is reported.

  + If the typed array column is set to `NULL`, the storage engine stores a single record containing `NULL` that points to the data record.

  + `JSON` null values are not permitted in indexed arrays. If any returned value is `NULL`, it is treated as a JSON null and an Invalid JSON value error is reported.

* Because multi-valued indexes are virtual indexes on virtual columns, they must adhere to the same rules as secondary indexes on virtual generated columns.

* Index records are not added for empty arrays.

##### Limitations and Restrictions on Multi-valued Indexes

Multi-valued indexes are subject to the limitations and restrictions listed here:

* Only one multi-valued key part is permitted per multi-valued index. However, the `CAST(... AS ... ARRAY)` expression can refer to multiple arrays within a `JSON` document, as shown here:

  ```
  CAST(data->'$.arr[*][*]' AS UNSIGNED ARRAY)
  ```

  In this case, all values matching the JSON expression are stored in the index as a single flat array.

* An index with a multi-valued key part does not support ordering and therefore cannot be used as a primary key. For the same reason, a multi-valued index cannot be defined using the `ASC` or `DESC` keyword.

* A multi-valued index cannot be a covering index.
* The maximum number of values per record for a multi-valued index is determined by the amount of data than can be stored on a single undo log page, which is 65221 bytes (64K minus 315 bytes for overhead), which means that the maximum total length of key values is also 65221 bytes. The maximum number of keys depends on various factors, which prevents defining a specific limit. Tests have shown a multi-valued index to permit as many as 1604 integer keys per record, for example. When the limit is reached, an error similar to the following is reported: ERROR 3905 (HY000): Exceeded max number of values per record for multi-valued index 'idx' by 1 value(s).

* The only type of expression that is permitted in a multi-valued key part is a `JSON` expression. The expression need not reference an existing element in a JSON document inserted into the indexed column, but must itself be syntactically valid.

* Because index records for the same clustered index record are dispersed throughout a multi-valued index, a multi-valued index does not support range scans or index-only scans.

* Multi-valued indexes are not permitted in foreign key specifications.

* Index prefixes cannot be defined for multi-valued indexes.
* Multi-valued indexes cannot be defined on data cast as `BINARY` (see the description of the `CAST()` function).

* Online creation of a multi-value index is not supported, which means the operation uses `ALGORITHM=COPY`. See Performance and Space Requirements.

* Character sets and collations other than the following two combinations of character set and collation are not supported for multi-valued indexes:

  1. The `binary` character set with the default `binary` collation

  2. The `utf8mb4` character set with the default `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` collation.

* As with other indexes on columns of `InnoDB` tables, a multi-valued index cannot be created with `USING HASH`; attempting to do so results in a warning: This storage engine does not support the HASH index algorithm, storage engine default was used instead. (`USING BTREE` is supported as usual.)

#### Spatial Indexes

The `MyISAM`, `InnoDB`, `NDB`, and `ARCHIVE` storage engines support spatial columns such as `POINT` and `GEOMETRY`. (Section 13.4, “Spatial Data Types”, describes the spatial data types.) However, support for spatial column indexing varies among engines. Spatial and nonspatial indexes on spatial columns are available according to the following rules.

Spatial indexes on spatial columns have these characteristics:

* Available only for `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` tables. Specifying `SPATIAL INDEX` for other storage engines results in an error.

* An index on a spatial column *must* be a `SPATIAL` index. The `SPATIAL` keyword is thus optional but implicit for creating an index on a spatial column.

* Available for single spatial columns only. A spatial index cannot be created over multiple spatial columns.

* Indexed columns must be `NOT NULL`.
* Column prefix lengths are prohibited. The full width of each column is indexed.

* Not permitted for a primary key or unique index.

Nonspatial indexes on spatial columns (created with `INDEX`, `UNIQUE`, or `PRIMARY KEY`) have these characteristics:

* Permitted for any storage engine that supports spatial columns except `ARCHIVE`.

* Columns can be `NULL` unless the index is a primary key.

* The index type for a non-`SPATIAL` index depends on the storage engine. Currently, B-tree is used.

* Permitted for a column that can have `NULL` values only for `InnoDB`, `MyISAM`, and `MEMORY` tables.

#### Index Options

Following the key part list, index options can be given. An *`index_option`* value can be any of the following:

* `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE [=] value`

  For `MyISAM` tables, `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` optionally specifies the size in bytes to use for index key blocks. The value is treated as a hint; a different size could be used if necessary. A `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` value specified for an individual index definition overrides a table-level `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` value.

  `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` is not supported at the index level for `InnoDB` tables. See Section 15.1.24, “CREATE TABLE Statement”.

* *`index_type`*

  Some storage engines permit you to specify an index type when creating an index. For example:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE lookup (id INT) ENGINE = MEMORY;
  CREATE INDEX id_index ON lookup (id) USING BTREE;
  ```

  Table 15.1, “Index Types Per Storage Engine” shows the permissible index type values supported by different storage engines. Where multiple index types are listed, the first one is the default when no index type specifier is given. Storage engines not listed in the table do not support an *`index_type`* clause in index definitions.

  **Table 15.1 Index Types Per Storage Engine**

  <table summary="Permissible index types by storage engine."><col style="width: 20%"/><col style="width: 50%"/><thead><tr> <th>Storage Engine</th> <th>Permissible Index Types</th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr> <td><a class="link" href="innodb-storage-engine.html" title="Chapter 17 The InnoDB Storage Engine"><code class="literal">InnoDB</code></a></td> <td><code class="literal">BTREE</code></td> </tr><tr> <td><a class="link" href="myisam-storage-engine.html" title="18.2 The MyISAM Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MyISAM</code></a></td> <td><code class="literal">BTREE</code></td> </tr><tr> <td><a class="link" href="memory-storage-engine.html" title="18.3 The MEMORY Storage Engine"><code class="literal">MEMORY</code></a>/<code class="literal">HEAP</code></td> <td><code class="literal">HASH</code>, <code class="literal">BTREE</code></td> </tr><tr> <td><a class="link" href="mysql-cluster.html" title="Chapter 25 MySQL NDB Cluster 9.5"><code class="literal">NDB</code></a></td> <td><code class="literal">HASH</code>, <code class="literal">BTREE</code> (see note in text)</td> </tr></tbody></table>

  The *`index_type`* clause cannot be used for `FULLTEXT INDEX` specifications. Full-text index implementation is storage-engine dependent. Spatial indexes are implemented as R-tree indexes.

  If you specify an index type that is not valid for a given storage engine, but another index type is available that the engine can use without affecting query results, the engine uses the available type. The parser recognizes `RTREE` as a type name. This is permitted only for `SPATIAL` indexes.

  `BTREE` indexes are implemented by the `NDB` storage engine as T-tree indexes.

  Note

  For indexes on `NDB` table columns, the `USING` option can be specified only for a unique index or primary key. `USING HASH` prevents the creation of an ordered index; otherwise, creating a unique index or primary key on an `NDB` table automatically results in the creation of both an ordered index and a hash index, each of which indexes the same set of columns.

  For unique indexes that include one or more `NULL` columns of an `NDB` table, the hash index can be used only to look up literal values, which means that `IS [NOT] NULL` conditions require a full scan of the table. One workaround is to make sure that a unique index using one or more `NULL` columns on such a table is always created in such a way that it includes the ordered index; that is, avoid employing `USING HASH` when creating the index.

  If you specify an index type that is not valid for a given storage engine, but another index type is available that the engine can use without affecting query results, the engine uses the available type. The parser recognizes `RTREE` as a type name, but currently this cannot be specified for any storage engine.

  Note

  Use of the *`index_type`* option before the `ON tbl_name` clause is deprecated; expect support for use of the option in this position to be removed in a future MySQL release. If an *`index_type`* option is given in both the earlier and later positions, the final option applies.

  `TYPE type_name` is recognized as a synonym for `USING type_name`. However, `USING` is the preferred form.

  The following tables show index characteristics for the storage engines that support the *`index_type`* option.

  Table note:

  1. `USING HASH` prevents creation of an implicit ordered index.

* `WITH PARSER parser_name`

  This option can be used only with `FULLTEXT` indexes. It associates a parser plugin with the index if full-text indexing and searching operations need special handling. `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` support full-text parser plugins. If you have a `MyISAM` table with an associated full-text parser plugin, you can convert the table to `InnoDB` using `ALTER TABLE`. See Full-Text Parser Plugins and Writing Full-Text Parser Plugins for more information.

* `COMMENT 'string'`

  Index definitions can include an optional comment of up to 1024 characters.

  The `MERGE_THRESHOLD` for index pages can be configured for individual indexes using the *`index_option`* `COMMENT` clause of the `CREATE INDEX` statement. For example:

  ```
  CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT);
  CREATE INDEX id_index ON t1 (id) COMMENT 'MERGE_THRESHOLD=40';
  ```

  If the page-full percentage for an index page falls below the `MERGE_THRESHOLD` value when a row is deleted or when a row is shortened by an update operation, `InnoDB` attempts to merge the index page with a neighboring index page. The default `MERGE_THRESHOLD` value is 50, which is the previously hardcoded value.

  `MERGE_THRESHOLD` can also be defined at the index level and table level using `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE` statements. For more information, see Section 17.8.11, “Configuring the Merge Threshold for Index Pages”.

* `VISIBLE`, `INVISIBLE`

  Specify index visibility. Indexes are visible by default. An invisible index is not used by the optimizer. Specification of index visibility applies to indexes other than primary keys (either explicit or implicit). For more information, see Section 10.3.12, “Invisible Indexes”.

* The `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` and `SECONDARY_ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` are used to specify index attributes for primary and secondary storage engines. The options are reserved for future use.

  The value assigned to this option is a string literal containing a valid JSON document or an empty string (''). Invalid JSON is rejected.

  ```
  CREATE INDEX i1 ON t1 (c1) ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE='{"key":"value"}';
  ```

  `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` and `SECONDARY_ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values can be repeated without error. In this case, the last specified value is used.

  `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` and `SECONDARY_ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values are not checked by the server, nor are they cleared when the table's storage engine is changed.

#### Table Copying and Locking Options

`ALGORITHM` and `LOCK` clauses may be given to influence the table copying method and level of concurrency for reading and writing the table while its indexes are being modified. They have the same meaning as for the `ALTER TABLE` statement. For more information, see Section 15.1.11, “ALTER TABLE Statement”

NDB Cluster supports online operations using the same `ALGORITHM=INPLACE` syntax used with the standard MySQL Server. See Section 25.6.12, “Online Operations with ALTER TABLE in NDB Cluster”, for more information.
