### 15.1.25 CREATE TABLESPACE Statement

```
CREATE [UNDO] TABLESPACE tablespace_name

  InnoDB and NDB:
    [ADD DATAFILE 'file_name']
    [AUTOEXTEND_SIZE [=] value]

  InnoDB only:
    [FILE_BLOCK_SIZE = value]
    [ENCRYPTION [=] {'Y' | 'N'}]

  NDB only:
    USE LOGFILE GROUP logfile_group
    [EXTENT_SIZE [=] extent_size]
    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] initial_size]
    [MAX_SIZE [=] max_size]
    [NODEGROUP [=] nodegroup_id]
    [WAIT]
    [COMMENT [=] 'string']

  InnoDB and NDB:
    [ENGINE [=] engine_name]

  Reserved for future use:
    [ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE [=] 'string']
```

This statement is used to create a tablespace. The precise syntax and semantics depend on the storage engine used. In standard MySQL releases, this is always an `InnoDB` tablespace. MySQL NDB Cluster also supports tablespaces using the `NDB` storage engine.

#### Considerations for InnoDB

`CREATE TABLESPACE` syntax is used to create general tablespaces or undo tablespaces. The `UNDO` keyword must be specified to create an undo tablespace.

A general tablespace is a shared tablespace. It can hold multiple tables, and supports all table row formats. General tablespaces can be created in a location relative to or independent of the data directory.

After creating an `InnoDB` general tablespace, use `CREATE TABLE tbl_name ... TABLESPACE [=] tablespace_name` or `ALTER TABLE tbl_name TABLESPACE [=] tablespace_name` to add tables to the tablespace. For more information, see Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”.

Undo tablespaces contain undo logs. Undo tablespaces can be created in a chosen location by specifying a fully qualified data file path. For more information, see Section 17.6.3.4, “Undo Tablespaces”.

#### Considerations for NDB Cluster

This statement is used to create a tablespace, which can contain one or more data files, providing storage space for NDB Cluster Disk Data tables (see Section 25.6.11, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables”). One data file is created and added to the tablespace using this statement. Additional data files may be added to the tablespace by using the `ALTER TABLESPACE` statement (see Section 15.1.12, “ALTER TABLESPACE Statement”).

Note

All NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This means that *each Disk Data object* must be uniquely named (and not merely each Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot have a tablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a tablespace and a data file with the same name.

A log file group of one or more `UNDO` log files must be assigned to the tablespace to be created with the `USE LOGFILE GROUP` clause. *`logfile_group`* must be an existing log file group created with `CREATE LOGFILE GROUP` (see Section 15.1.20, “CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement”). Multiple tablespaces may use the same log file group for `UNDO` logging.

When setting `EXTENT_SIZE` or `INITIAL_SIZE`, you may optionally follow the number with a one-letter abbreviation for an order of magnitude, similar to those used in `my.cnf`. Generally, this is one of the letters `M` (for megabytes) or `G` (for gigabytes).

`INITIAL_SIZE` and `EXTENT_SIZE` are subject to rounding as follows:

* `EXTENT_SIZE` is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of 32K.

* `INITIAL_SIZE` is rounded *down* to the nearest whole multiple of 32K; this result is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of `EXTENT_SIZE` (after any rounding).

Note

`NDB` reserves 4% of a tablespace for data node restart operations. This reserved space cannot be used for data storage.

The rounding just described is done explicitly, and a warning is issued by the MySQL Server when any such rounding is performed. The rounded values are also used by the NDB kernel for calculating `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES` column values and other purposes. However, to avoid an unexpected result, we suggest that you always use whole multiples of 32K in specifying these options.

When `CREATE TABLESPACE` is used with `ENGINE [=] NDB`, a tablespace and associated data file are created on each Cluster data node. You can verify that the data files were created and obtain information about them by querying the Information Schema `FILES` table. (See the example later in this section.)

(See Section 28.3.15, “The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table”.)

#### Options

* `ADD DATAFILE`: Defines the name of a tablespace data file. This option is always required when creating an `NDB` tablespace; for `InnoDB`, it is required only when creating an undo tablespace. The `file_name`, including any specified path, must be quoted with single or double quotation marks. File names (not counting the file extension) and directory names must be at least one byte in length. Zero length file names and directory names are not supported.

  Because there are considerable differences in how `InnoDB` and `NDB` treat data files, the two storage engines are covered separately in the discussion that follows.

  **InnoDB data files.** An `InnoDB` tablespace supports only a single data file, whose name must include an `.ibd` extension.

  To place an `InnoDB` general tablespace data file in a location outside of the data directory, include a fully qualified path or a path relative to the data directory. Only a fully qualified path is permitted for undo tablespaces. If you do not specify a path, a general tablespace is created in the data directory. An undo tablespace created without specifying a path is created in the directory defined by the `innodb_undo_directory` variable. If `innodb_undo_directory` is not set, undo tablespaces are created in the data directory.

  To avoid conflicts with implicitly created file-per-table tablespaces, creating an `InnoDB` general tablespace in a subdirectory under the data directory is not supported. When creating a general tablespace or undo tablespace outside of the data directory, the directory must exist and must be known to `InnoDB` prior to creating the tablespace. To make a directory known to `InnoDB`, add it to the `innodb_directories` value or to one of the variables whose values are appended to the value of `innodb_directories`. `innodb_directories` is a read-only variable. Configuring it requires restarting the server.

  If the `ADD DATAFILE` clause is not specified when creating an `InnoDB` tablespace, a tablespace data file with a unique file name is created implicitly. The unique file name is a 128 bit UUID formatted into five groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by dashes (*`aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee`*). A file extension is added if required by the storage engine. An `.ibd` file extension is added for `InnoDB` general tablespace data files. In a replication environment, the data file name created on the replication source server is not the same as the data file name created on the replica.

  The `ADD DATAFILE` clause does not permit circular directory references when creating an `InnoDB` tablespace. For example, the circular directory reference (`/../`) in the following statement is not permitted:

  ```
  CREATE TABLESPACE ts1 ADD DATAFILE ts1.ibd 'any_directory/../ts1.ibd';
  ```

  An exception to this restriction exists on Linux, where a circular directory reference is permitted if the preceding directory is a symbolic link. For example, the data file path in the example above is permitted if *`any_directory`* is a symbolic link. (It is still permitted for data file paths to begin with '`../`'.)

  **NDB data files.** An `NDB` tablespace supports multiple data files which can have any legal file names; more data files can be added to an NDB Cluster tablespace following its creation by using an `ALTER TABLESPACE` statement.

  An `NDB` tablespace data file is created by default in the data node file system directory—that is, the directory named `ndb_nodeid_fs/TS` under the data node's data directory (`DataDir`), where *`nodeid`* is the data node's `NodeId`. To place the data file in a location other than the default, include an absolute directory path or a path relative to the default location. If the directory specified does not exist, `NDB` attempts to create it; the system user account under which the data node process is running must have the appropriate permissions to do so.

  Note

  When determining the path used for a data file, `NDB` does not expand the `~` (tilde) character.

  When multiple data nodes are run on the same physical host, the following considerations apply:

  + You cannot specify an absolute path when creating a data file.

  + It is not possible to create tablespace data files outside the data node file system directory, unless each data node has a separate data directory.

  + If each data node has its own data directory, data files can be created anywhere within this directory.

  + If each data node has its own data directory, it may also be possible to create a data file outside the node's data directory using a relative path, as long as this path resolves to a unique location on the host file system for each data node running on that host.

* `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE`: This option—which is specific to `InnoDB` general tablespaces, and is ignored by `NDB`—defines the block size for the tablespace data file. Values can be specified in bytes or kilobytes. For example, an 8 kilobyte file block size can be specified as 8192 or 8K. If you do not specify this option, `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` defaults to the `innodb_page_size` value. `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` is required when you intend to use the tablespace for storing compressed `InnoDB` tables (`ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`). In this case, you must define the tablespace `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` when creating the tablespace.

  If `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` is equal the `innodb_page_size` value, the tablespace can contain only tables having an uncompressed row format (`COMPACT`, `REDUNDANT`, and `DYNAMIC`). Tables with a `COMPRESSED` row format have a different physical page size than uncompressed tables. Therefore, compressed tables cannot coexist in the same tablespace as uncompressed tables.

  For a general tablespace to contain compressed tables, `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` must be specified, and the `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` value must be a valid compressed page size in relation to the `innodb_page_size` value. Also, the physical page size of the compressed table (`KEY_BLOCK_SIZE`) must be equal to `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE/1024`. For example, if `innodb_page_size=16K`, and `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE=8K`, the `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` of the table must be 8. For more information, see Section 17.6.3.3, “General Tablespaces”.

* `USE LOGFILE GROUP`: Required for `NDB`, this is the name of a log file group previously created using `CREATE LOGFILE GROUP`. Not supported for `InnoDB`, where it fails with an error.

* `EXTENT_SIZE`: This option is specific to NDB, and is not supported by InnoDB, where it fails with an error. `EXTENT_SIZE` sets the size, in bytes, of the extents used by any files belonging to the tablespace. The default value is 1M. The minimum size is 32K, and theoretical maximum is 2G, although the practical maximum size depends on a number of factors. In most cases, changing the extent size does not have any measurable effect on performance, and the default value is recommended for all but the most unusual situations.

  An extent is a unit of disk space allocation. One extent is filled with as much data as that extent can contain before another extent is used. In theory, up to 65,535 (64K) extents may used per data file; however, the recommended maximum is 32,768 (32K). The recommended maximum size for a single data file is 32G—that is, 32K extents × 1 MB per extent. In addition, once an extent is allocated to a given partition, it cannot be used to store data from a different partition; an extent cannot store data from more than one partition. This means, for example that a tablespace having a single datafile whose `INITIAL_SIZE` (described in the following item) is 256 MB and whose `EXTENT_SIZE` is 128M has just two extents, and so can be used to store data from at most two different disk data table partitions.

  You can see how many extents remain free in a given data file by querying the Information Schema `FILES` table, and so derive an estimate for how much space remains free in the file. For further discussion and examples, see Section 28.3.15, “The INFORMATION_SCHEMA FILES Table”.

* `INITIAL_SIZE`: This option is specific to `NDB`, and is not supported by `InnoDB`, where it fails with an error.

  The `INITIAL_SIZE` parameter sets the total size in bytes of the data file that was specific using `ADD DATATFILE`. Once this file has been created, its size cannot be changed; however, you can add more data files to the tablespace using `ALTER TABLESPACE ... ADD DATAFILE`.

  `INITIAL_SIZE` is optional; its default value is 134217728 (128 MB).

  On 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for `INITIAL_SIZE` is 4294967296 (4 GB).

* `AUTOEXTEND_SIZE`: Defines the amount by which `InnoDB` extends the size of the tablespace when it becomes full. The setting must be a multiple of 4MB. The default setting is 0, which causes the tablespace to be extended according to the implicit default behavior. For more information, see Section 17.6.3.9, “Tablespace AUTOEXTEND_SIZE Configuration”.

  Has no effect in any release of MySQL NDB Cluster, regardless of the storage engine used.

* `MAX_SIZE`: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL or MySQL NDB Cluster, regardless of the storage engine used.

* `NODEGROUP`: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL or MySQL NDB Cluster, regardless of the storage engine used.

* `WAIT`: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL or MySQL NDB Cluster, regardless of the storage engine used.

* `COMMENT`: Currently ignored by MySQL; reserved for possible future use. Has no effect in any release of MySQL or MySQL NDB Cluster, regardless of the storage engine used.

* The `ENCRYPTION` clause enables or disables page-level data encryption for an `InnoDB` general tablespace.

  If the `ENCRYPTION` clause is not specified, the `default_table_encryption` setting controls whether encryption is enabled. The `ENCRYPTION` clause overrides the `default_table_encryption` setting. However, if the `table_encryption_privilege_check` variable is enabled, the `TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN` privilege is required to use an `ENCRYPTION` clause setting that differs from the `default_table_encryption` setting.

  A keyring plugin must be installed and configured before an encryption-enabled tablespace can be created.

  When a general tablespace is encrypted, all tables residing in the tablespace are encrypted. Likewise, a table created in an encrypted tablespace is encrypted.

  For more information, see Section 17.13, “InnoDB Data-at-Rest Encryption”

* `ENGINE`: Defines the storage engine which uses the tablespace, where *`engine_name`* is the name of the storage engine. Currently, only the `InnoDB` storage engine is supported by standard MySQL 9.5 releases. MySQL NDB Cluster supports both `NDB` and `InnoDB` tablespaces. The value of the `default_storage_engine` system variable is used for `ENGINE` if the option is not specified.

* The `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` option is used to specify tablespace attributes for primary storage engines. The option is reserved for future use.

  The value assigned to this option must be a string literal containing a valid JSON document or an empty string (''). Invalid JSON is rejected.

  ```
  CREATE TABLESPACE ts1 ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE='{"key":"value"}';
  ```

  `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values can be repeated without error. In this case, the last specified value is used.

  `ENGINE_ATTRIBUTE` values are not checked by the server, nor are they cleared when the table's storage engine is changed.

#### Notes

* For the rules covering the naming of MySQL tablespaces, see Section 11.2, “Schema Object Names”. In addition to these rules, the slash character (“/”) is not permitted, nor can you use names beginning with `innodb_`, as this prefix is reserved for system use.

* Creation of temporary general tablespaces is not supported.
* General tablespaces do not support temporary tables.
* The `TABLESPACE` option may be used with `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` to assign an `InnoDB` table partition or subpartition to a file-per-table tablespace. All partitions must belong to the same storage engine. Assigning table partitions to shared `InnoDB` tablespaces is not supported. Shared tablespaces include the `InnoDB` system tablespace and general tablespaces.

* General tablespaces support the addition of tables of any row format using `CREATE TABLE ... TABLESPACE`. `innodb_file_per_table` does not need to be enabled.

* `innodb_strict_mode` is not applicable to general tablespaces. Tablespace management rules are strictly enforced independently of `innodb_strict_mode`. If `CREATE TABLESPACE` parameters are incorrect or incompatible, the operation fails regardless of the `innodb_strict_mode` setting. When a table is added to a general tablespace using `CREATE TABLE ... TABLESPACE` or `ALTER TABLE ... TABLESPACE`, `innodb_strict_mode` is ignored but the statement is evaluated as if `innodb_strict_mode` is enabled.

* Use `DROP TABLESPACE` to remove a tablespace. All tables must be dropped from a tablespace using `DROP TABLE` prior to dropping the tablespace. Before dropping an NDB Cluster tablespace you must also remove all its data files using one or more `ALTER TABLESPACE ... DROP DATATFILE` statements. See Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”.

* All parts of an `InnoDB` table added to an `InnoDB` general tablespace reside in the general tablespace, including indexes and `BLOB` pages.

  For an `NDB` table assigned to a tablespace, only those columns which are not indexed are stored on disk, and actually use the tablespace data files. Indexes and indexed columns for all `NDB` tables are always kept in memory.

* Similar to the system tablespace, truncating or dropping tables stored in a general tablespace creates free space internally in the general tablespace .ibd data file which can only be used for new `InnoDB` data. Space is not released back to the operating system as it is for file-per-table tablespaces.

* A general tablespace is not associated with any database or schema.

* `ALTER TABLE ... DISCARD TABLESPACE` and `ALTER TABLE ...IMPORT TABLESPACE` are not supported for tables that belong to a general tablespace.

* The server uses tablespace-level metadata locking for DDL that references general tablespaces. By comparison, the server uses table-level metadata locking for DDL that references file-per-table tablespaces.

* A generated or existing tablespace cannot be changed to a general tablespace.

* There is no conflict between general tablespace names and file-per-table tablespace names. The “/” character, which is present in file-per-table tablespace names, is not permitted in general tablespace names.

* **mysqldump** does not dump `InnoDB` `CREATE TABLESPACE` statements.

#### InnoDB Examples

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding three uncompressed tables of different row formats.

```
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts1` ADD DATAFILE 'ts1.ibd' ENGINE=INNODB;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=COMPACT;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t3 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts1 ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;
```

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace and adding a compressed table. The example assumes a default `innodb_page_size` value of 16K. The `FILE_BLOCK_SIZE` of 8192 requires that the compressed table have a `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE` of 8.

```
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts2` ADD DATAFILE 'ts2.ibd' FILE_BLOCK_SIZE = 8192 ENGINE=InnoDB;

mysql> CREATE TABLE t4 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY) TABLESPACE ts2 ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=8;
```

This example demonstrates creating a general tablespace without specifying the `ADD DATAFILE` clause, which is optional:

```
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE `ts3` ENGINE=INNODB;
```

This example demonstrates creating an undo tablespace:

```
mysql> CREATE UNDO TABLESPACE undo_003 ADD DATAFILE 'undo_003.ibu';
```

#### NDB Example

Suppose that you wish to create an NDB Cluster Disk Data tablespace named `myts` using a datafile named `mydata-1.dat`. An `NDB` tablespace always requires the use of a log file group consisting of one or more undo log files. For this example, we first create a log file group named `mylg` that contains one undo long file named `myundo-1.dat`, using the `CREATE LOGFILE GROUP` statement shown here:

```
mysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP myg1
    ->     ADD UNDOFILE 'myundo-1.dat'
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (3.29 sec)
```

Now you can create the tablespace previously described using the following statement:

```
mysql> CREATE TABLESPACE myts
    ->     ADD DATAFILE 'mydata-1.dat'
    ->     USE LOGFILE GROUP mylg
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (2.98 sec)
```

You can now create a Disk Data table using a `CREATE TABLE` statement with the `TABLESPACE` and `STORAGE DISK` options, similar to what is shown here:

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE mytable (
    ->     id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ->     lname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ->     fname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    ->     dob DATE NOT NULL,
    ->     joined DATE NOT NULL,
    ->     INDEX(last_name, first_name)
    -> )
    ->     TABLESPACE myts STORAGE DISK
    ->     ENGINE=NDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.41 sec)
```

It is important to note that only the `dob` and `joined` columns from `mytable` are actually stored on disk, due to the fact that the `id`, `lname`, and `fname` columns are all indexed.

As mentioned previously, when `CREATE TABLESPACE` is used with `ENGINE [=] NDB`, a tablespace and its associated data file are created on each NDB Cluster data node. You can verify that the data files were created and obtain information about them by querying the Information Schema `FILES` table, as shown here:

```
mysql> SELECT FILE_NAME, FILE_TYPE, LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, STATUS, EXTRA
    ->     FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES
    ->     WHERE TABLESPACE_NAME = 'myts';

+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
| file_name    | file_type  | logfile_group_name | status | extra          |
+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=5 |
| mydata-1.dat | DATAFILE   | mylg               | NORMAL | CLUSTER_NODE=6 |
| NULL         | TABLESPACE | mylg               | NORMAL | NULL           |
+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

For additional information and examples, see Section 25.6.11.1, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Objects”.
