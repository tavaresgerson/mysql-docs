### 15.2.19 VALUES Statement

`VALUES` is a DML statement which returns a set of one or more rows as a table. In other words, it is a table value constructor which also functions as a standalone SQL statement.

```
VALUES row_constructor_list [ORDER BY column_designator] [LIMIT number]

row_constructor_list:
    ROW(value_list)[, ROW(value_list)][, ...]

value_list:
    value[, value][, ...]

column_designator:
    column_index
```

The `VALUES` statement consists of the `VALUES` keyword followed by a list of one or more row constructors, separated by commas. A row constructor consists of the `ROW()` row constructor clause with a value list of one or more scalar values enclosed in the parentheses. A value can be a literal of any MySQL data type or an expression that resolves to a scalar value.

`ROW()` cannot be empty (but each of the supplied scalar values can be `NULL`). Each `ROW()` in the same `VALUES` statement must have the same number of values in its value list.

The `DEFAULT` keyword is not supported by `VALUES` and causes a syntax error, except when it is used to supply values in an `INSERT` statement.

The output of `VALUES` is a table:

```
mysql> VALUES ROW(1,-2,3), ROW(5,7,9), ROW(4,6,8);
+----------+----------+----------+
| column_0 | column_1 | column_2 |
+----------+----------+----------+
|        1 |       -2 |        3 |
|        5 |        7 |        9 |
|        4 |        6 |        8 |
+----------+----------+----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The columns of the table output from `VALUES` have the implicitly named columns `column_0`, `column_1`, `column_2`, and so on, always beginning with `0`. This fact can be used to order the rows by column using an optional `ORDER BY` clause in the same way that this clause works with a `SELECT` statement, as shown here:

```
mysql> VALUES ROW(1,-2,3), ROW(5,7,9), ROW(4,6,8) ORDER BY column_1;
+----------+----------+----------+
| column_0 | column_1 | column_2 |
+----------+----------+----------+
|        1 |       -2 |        3 |
|        4 |        6 |        8 |
|        5 |        7 |        9 |
+----------+----------+----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

`VALUES` statement also supports a `LIMIT` clause for limiting the number of rows in the output.

The `VALUES` statement is permissive regarding data types of column values; you can mix types within the same column, as shown here:

```
mysql> VALUES ROW("q", 42, '2019-12-18'),
    ->     ROW(23, "abc", 98.6),
    ->     ROW(27.0002, "Mary Smith", '{"a": 10, "b": 25}');
+----------+------------+--------------------+
| column_0 | column_1   | column_2           |
+----------+------------+--------------------+
| q        | 42         | 2019-12-18         |
| 23       | abc        | 98.6               |
| 27.0002  | Mary Smith | {"a": 10, "b": 25} |
+----------+------------+--------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Important

`VALUES` with one or more instances of `ROW()` acts as a table value constructor; although it can be used to supply values in an `INSERT` or `REPLACE` statement, do not confuse it with the `VALUES` keyword that is also used for this purpose. You should also not confuse it with the `VALUES()` function that refers to column values in `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`.

You should also bear in mind that `ROW()` is a row value constructor (see Section 15.2.15.5, “Row Subqueries”), whereas `VALUES ROW()` is a table value constructor; the two cannot be used interchangeably.

`VALUES` can be used in many cases where you could employ `SELECT`, including those listed here:

* With `UNION`, as shown here:

  ```
  mysql> SELECT 1,2 UNION SELECT 10,15;
  +----+----+
  | 1  | 2  |
  +----+----+
  |  1 |  2 |
  | 10 | 15 |
  +----+----+
  2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> VALUES ROW(1,2) UNION VALUES ROW(10,15);
  +----------+----------+
  | column_0 | column_1 |
  +----------+----------+
  |        1 |        2 |
  |       10 |       15 |
  +----------+----------+
  2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  You can union together constructed tables having more than one row, like this:

  ```
  mysql> VALUES ROW(1,2), ROW(3,4), ROW(5,6)
       >     UNION VALUES ROW(10,15),ROW(20,25);
  +----------+----------+
  | column_0 | column_1 |
  +----------+----------+
  |        1 |        2 |
  |        3 |        4 |
  |        5 |        6 |
  |       10 |       15 |
  |       20 |       25 |
  +----------+----------+
  5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  You can also (and it is usually preferable to) omit `UNION` altogether in such cases and use a single **`VALUES`** statement, like this:

  ```
  mysql> VALUES ROW(1,2), ROW(3,4), ROW(5,6), ROW(10,15), ROW(20,25);
  +----------+----------+
  | column_0 | column_1 |
  +----------+----------+
  |        1 |        2 |
  |        3 |        4 |
  |        5 |        6 |
  |       10 |       15 |
  |       20 |       25 |
  +----------+----------+
  ```

  `VALUES` can also be used in unions with `SELECT` statements, `TABLE` statements, or both.

  The constructed tables in the `UNION` must contain the same number of columns, just as if you were using `SELECT`. See Section 15.2.18, “UNION Clause”, for further examples.

  You can use `EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT` with `VALUES` in much the same way as `UNION`, as shown here:

  ```
  mysql> VALUES ROW(1,2), ROW(3,4), ROW(5,6)
      ->   INTERSECT
      -> VALUES ROW(10,15), ROW(20,25), ROW(3,4);
  +----------+----------+
  | column_0 | column_1 |
  +----------+----------+
  |        3 |        4 |
  +----------+----------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> VALUES ROW(1,2), ROW(3,4), ROW(5,6)
      ->   EXCEPT
      -> VALUES ROW(10,15), ROW(20,25), ROW(3,4);
  +----------+----------+
  | column_0 | column_1 |
  +----------+----------+
  |        1 |        2 |
  |        5 |        6 |
  +----------+----------+
  2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  See Section 15.2.4, “EXCEPT Clause”, and Section 15.2.8, “INTERSECT Clause”, for more information.

* In joins. See Section 15.2.13.2, “JOIN Clause”, for more information and examples.

* In place of `VALUES()` in an `INSERT` or `REPLACE` statement, in which case its semantics differ slightly from what is described here. See Section 15.2.7, “INSERT Statement”, for details.

* In place of the source table in `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT` and `CREATE VIEW ... SELECT`. See the descriptions of these statements for more information and examples.
