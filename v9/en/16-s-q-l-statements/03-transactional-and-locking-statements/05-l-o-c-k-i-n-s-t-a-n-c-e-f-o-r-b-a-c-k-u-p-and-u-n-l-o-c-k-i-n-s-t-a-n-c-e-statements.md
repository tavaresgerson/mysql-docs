### 15.3.5 LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP and UNLOCK INSTANCE Statements

```
LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP

UNLOCK INSTANCE
```

`LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` acquires an instance-level *backup lock* that permits DML during an online backup while preventing operations that could result in an inconsistent snapshot.

Executing the `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` statement requires the `BACKUP_ADMIN` privilege. The `BACKUP_ADMIN` privilege is automatically granted to users with the `RELOAD` privilege when performing an in-place upgrade to MySQL 9.5 from an earlier version.

Multiple sessions can hold a backup lock simultaneously.

`UNLOCK INSTANCE` releases a backup lock held by the current session. A backup lock held by a session is also released if the session is terminated.

`LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` prevents files from being created, renamed, or removed. `REPAIR TABLE` `TRUNCATE TABLE`, `OPTIMIZE TABLE`, and account management statements are blocked. See Section 15.7.1, “Account Management Statements”. Operations that modify `InnoDB` files that are not recorded in the `InnoDB` redo log are also blocked.

`LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` permits DDL operations that only affect user-created temporary tables. In effect, files that belong to user-created temporary tables can be created, renamed, or removed while a backup lock is held. Creation of binary log files is also permitted.

`PURGE BINARY LOGS` cannot be issued while a `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` statement is in effect for the instance, because it contravenes the rules of the backup lock by removing files from the server.

A backup lock acquired by `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` is independent of transactional locks and locks taken by `FLUSH TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK`, and the following sequences of statements are permitted:

```
LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP;
FLUSH TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK;
UNLOCK TABLES;
UNLOCK INSTANCE;
```

```
FLUSH TABLES tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... WITH READ LOCK;
LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP;
UNLOCK INSTANCE;
UNLOCK TABLES;
```

The `lock_wait_timeout` setting defines the amount of time that a `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` statement waits to acquire a lock before giving up.
