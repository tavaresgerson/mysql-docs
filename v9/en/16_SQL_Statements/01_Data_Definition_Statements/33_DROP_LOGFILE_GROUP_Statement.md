### 15.1.33 DROP LOGFILE GROUP Statement

```
DROP LOGFILE GROUP logfile_group
    ENGINE [=] engine_name
```

This statement drops the log file group named *`logfile_group`*. The log file group must already exist or an error results. (For information on creating log file groups, see Section 15.1.20, “CREATE LOGFILE GROUP Statement”.)

Important

Before dropping a log file group, you must drop all tablespaces that use that log file group for `UNDO` logging.

The required `ENGINE` clause provides the name of the storage engine used by the log file group to be dropped. The only permitted values for *`engine_name`* are `NDB` and `NDBCLUSTER`.

`DROP LOGFILE GROUP` is useful only with Disk Data storage for NDB Cluster. See Section 25.6.11, “NDB Cluster Disk Data Tables”.
