### 15.1.35 DROP SERVER Statement

```
DROP SERVER [ IF EXISTS ] server_name
```

Drops the server definition for the server named `server_name`. The corresponding row in the `mysql.servers` table is deleted. This statement requires the `SUPER` privilege.

Dropping a server for a table does not affect any `FEDERATED` tables that used this connection information when they were created. See Section 15.1.22, “CREATE SERVER Statement”.

`DROP SERVER` causes an implicit commit. See Section 15.3.3, “Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit”.

`DROP SERVER` is not written to the binary log, regardless of the logging format that is in use.
