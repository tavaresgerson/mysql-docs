### 15.1.34 DROP PROCEDURE and DROP FUNCTION Statements

```
DROP {PROCEDURE | FUNCTION} [IF EXISTS] sp_name
```

These statements are used to drop a stored routine (a stored procedure or function). That is, the specified routine is removed from the server. (`DROP FUNCTION` is also used to drop loadable functions; see Section 15.7.4.2, “DROP FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions”.)

To drop a stored routine, you must have the `ALTER ROUTINE` privilege for it. (If the `automatic_sp_privileges` system variable is enabled, that privilege and `EXECUTE` are granted automatically to the routine creator when the routine is created and dropped from the creator when the routine is dropped. See Section 27.2.2, “Stored Routines and MySQL Privileges”.)

In addition, if the definer of the routine has the `SYSTEM_USER` privilege, the user dropping it must also have this privilege.

The `IF EXISTS` clause is a MySQL extension. It prevents an error from occurring if the procedure or function does not exist. A warning is produced that can be viewed with `SHOW WARNINGS`.

`DROP FUNCTION` is also used to drop loadable functions (see Section 15.7.4.2, “DROP FUNCTION Statement for Loadable Functions”).
