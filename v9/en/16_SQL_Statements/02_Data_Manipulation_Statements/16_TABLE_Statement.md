### 15.2.16 TABLE Statement

`TABLE` is a DML statement which returns rows and columns of the named table.

```
TABLE table_name
    [ORDER BY column_name]
    [LIMIT number [OFFSET number
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
        [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
            [TERMINATED BY 'string']
            OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
            [ESCAPED BY 'char']
        ]
        [LINES
            [STARTING BY 'string']
            [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        ]
    | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
    | INTO var_name [, var_name] ...]
```

The `TABLE` statement in some ways acts like `SELECT`. Given the existence of a table named `t`, the following two statements produce identical output:

```
TABLE t;

SELECT * FROM t;
```

You can order and limit the number of rows produced by `TABLE` using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses, respectively. These function identically to the same clauses when used with `SELECT` (including an optional `OFFSET` clause with `LIMIT`), as you can see here:

```
mysql> TABLE t;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
|  1 |  2 |
|  6 |  7 |
|  9 |  5 |
| 10 | -4 |
| 11 | -1 |
| 13 |  3 |
| 14 |  6 |
+----+----+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE t ORDER BY b;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
| 10 | -4 |
| 11 | -1 |
|  1 |  2 |
| 13 |  3 |
|  9 |  5 |
| 14 |  6 |
|  6 |  7 |
+----+----+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE t LIMIT 3;
+---+---+
| a | b |
+---+---+
| 1 | 2 |
| 6 | 7 |
| 9 | 5 |
+---+---+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE t ORDER BY b LIMIT 3;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
| 10 | -4 |
| 11 | -1 |
|  1 |  2 |
+----+----+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> TABLE t ORDER BY b LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;
+----+----+
| a  | b  |
+----+----+
|  1 |  2 |
| 13 |  3 |
|  9 |  5 |
+----+----+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

`TABLE` differs from `SELECT` in two key respects:

* `TABLE` always displays all columns of the table.

  *Exception*: The output of `TABLE` does *not* include invisible columns. See Section 15.1.24.10, “Invisible Columns”.

* `TABLE` does not allow for any arbitrary filtering of rows; that is, `TABLE` does not support any `WHERE` clause.

For limiting which table columns are returned, filtering rows beyond what can be accomplished using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, or both, use `SELECT`.

`TABLE` can be used with temporary tables.

`TABLE` can also be used in place of `SELECT` in a number of other constructs, including those listed here:

* With set operators such as `UNION`, as shown here:

  ```
  mysql> TABLE t1;
  +---+----+
  | a | b  |
  +---+----+
  | 2 | 10 |
  | 5 |  3 |
  | 7 |  8 |
  +---+----+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> TABLE t2;
  +---+---+
  | a | b |
  +---+---+
  | 1 | 2 |
  | 3 | 4 |
  | 6 | 7 |
  +---+---+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

  mysql> TABLE t1 UNION TABLE t2;
  +---+----+
  | a | b  |
  +---+----+
  | 2 | 10 |
  | 5 |  3 |
  | 7 |  8 |
  | 1 |  2 |
  | 3 |  4 |
  | 6 |  7 |
  +---+----+
  6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  The `UNION` just shown is equivalent to the following statement:

  ```
  mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT * FROM t2;
  +---+----+
  | a | b  |
  +---+----+
  | 2 | 10 |
  | 5 |  3 |
  | 7 |  8 |
  | 1 |  2 |
  | 3 |  4 |
  | 6 |  7 |
  +---+----+
  6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  `TABLE` can also be used together in set operations with `SELECT` statements, `VALUES` statements, or both. See Section 15.2.18, “UNION Clause”, Section 15.2.4, “EXCEPT Clause”, and Section 15.2.8, “INTERSECT Clause”, for more information and examples. See also Section 15.2.14, “Set Operations with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT”.

* With `INTO` to populate user variables, and with `INTO OUTFILE` or `INTO DUMPFILE` to write table data to a file. See Section 15.2.13.1, “SELECT ... INTO Statement”, for more specific information and examples.

* In many cases where you can employ subqueries. Given any table `t1` with a column named `a`, and a second table `t2` having a single column, statements such as the following are possible:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN (TABLE t2);
  ```

  Assuming that the single column of table `t1` is named `x`, the preceding is equivalent to each of the statements shown here (and produces exactly the same result in either case):

  ```
  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN (SELECT x FROM t2);

  SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN (SELECT * FROM t2);
  ```

  See Section 15.2.15, “Subqueries”, for more information.

* With `INSERT` and `REPLACE` statements, where you would otherwise use `SELECT *`. See Section 15.2.7.1, “INSERT ... SELECT Statement”, for more information and examples.

* `TABLE` can also be used in many cases in place of the `SELECT` in `CREATE TABLE ... SELECT` or `CREATE VIEW ... SELECT`. See the descriptions of these statements for more information and examples.
