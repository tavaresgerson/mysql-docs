#### 15.7.6.1 SET Syntax for Variable Assignment

```
SET variable = expr [, variable = expr] ...

variable: {
    user_var_name
  | param_name
  | local_var_name
  | {GLOBAL | @@GLOBAL.} system_var_name
  | {PERSIST | @@PERSIST.} system_var_name
  | {PERSIST_ONLY | @@PERSIST_ONLY.} system_var_name
  | [SESSION | @@SESSION. | @@] system_var_name
}
```

`SET` syntax for variable assignment enables you to assign values to different types of variables that affect the operation of the server or clients:

* User-defined variables. See Section 11.4, “User-Defined Variables”.

* Stored procedure and function parameters, and stored program local variables. See Section 15.6.4, “Variables in Stored Programs”.

* System variables. See Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”. System variables also can be set at server startup, as described in Section 7.1.9, “Using System Variables”.

A `SET` statement that assigns variable values is not written to the binary log, so in replication scenarios it affects only the host on which you execute it. To affect all replication hosts, execute the statement on each host.

The following sections describe `SET` syntax for setting variables. They use the `=` assignment operator, but the `:=` assignment operator is also permitted for this purpose.

* User-Defined Variable Assignment
* Parameter and Local Variable Assignment
* System Variable Assignment
* SET Error Handling
* Multiple Variable Assignment
* System Variable References in Expressions

##### User-Defined Variable Assignment

User-defined variables are created locally within a session and exist only within the context of that session; see Section 11.4, “User-Defined Variables”.

A user-defined variable is written as `@var_name` and is assigned an expression value as follows:

```
SET @var_name = expr;
```

Examples:

```
SET @name = 43;
SET @total_tax = (SELECT SUM(tax) FROM taxable_transactions);
```

As demonstrated by those statements, *`expr`* can range from simple (a literal value) to more complex (the value returned by a scalar subquery).

The Performance Schema `user_variables_by_thread` table contains information about user-defined variables. See Section 29.12.10, “Performance Schema User-Defined Variable Tables”.

##### Parameter and Local Variable Assignment

`SET` applies to parameters and local variables in the context of the stored object within which they are defined. The following procedure uses the `increment` procedure parameter and `counter` local variable:

```
CREATE PROCEDURE p(increment INT)
BEGIN
  DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 0;
  WHILE counter < 10 DO
    -- ... do work ...
    SET counter = counter + increment;
  END WHILE;
END;
```

##### System Variable Assignment

The MySQL server maintains system variables that configure its operation. A system variable can have a global value that affects server operation as a whole, a session value that affects the current session, or both. Many system variables are dynamic and can be changed at runtime using the `SET` statement to affect operation of the current server instance. `SET` can also be used to persist certain system variables to the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file in the data directory, to affect server operation for subsequent startups.

If a `SET` statement is issued for a sensitive system variable, the query is rewritten to replace the value with “`<redacted>`” before it is logged to the general log and audit log. This takes place even if secure storage through a keyring component is not available on the server instance.

If you change a session system variable, the value remains in effect within your session until you change the variable to a different value or the session ends. The change has no effect on other sessions.

If you change a global system variable, the value is remembered and used to initialize the session value for new sessions until you change the variable to a different value or the server exits. The change is visible to any client that accesses the global value. However, the change affects the corresponding session value only for clients that connect after the change. The global variable change does not affect the session value for any current client sessions (not even the session within which the global value change occurs).

To make a global system variable setting permanent so that it applies across server restarts, you can persist it to the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file in the data directory. It is also possible to make persistent configuration changes by manually modifying a `my.cnf` option file, but that is more cumbersome, and an error in a manually entered setting might not be discovered until much later. `SET` statements that persist system variables are more convenient and avoid the possibility of malformed settings because settings with syntax errors do not succeed and do not change server configuration. For more information about persisting system variables and the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file, see Section 7.1.9.3, “Persisted System Variables”.

Note

Setting or persisting a global system variable value always requires special privileges. Setting a session system variable value normally requires no special privileges and can be done by any user, although there are exceptions. For more information, see Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”.

The following discussion describes the syntax options for setting and persisting system variables:

* To assign a value to a global system variable, precede the variable name by the `GLOBAL` keyword or the `@@GLOBAL.` qualifier:

  ```
  SET GLOBAL max_connections = 1000;
  SET @@GLOBAL.max_connections = 1000;
  ```

* To assign a value to a session system variable, precede the variable name by the `SESSION` or `LOCAL` keyword, by the `@@SESSION.`, `@@LOCAL.`, or `@@` qualifier, or by no keyword or no modifier at all:

  ```
  SET SESSION sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  SET LOCAL sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  SET @@SESSION.sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  SET @@LOCAL.sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  SET @@sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  SET sql_mode = 'TRADITIONAL';
  ```

  A client can change its own session variables, but not those of any other client.

* To persist a global system variable to the `mysqld-auto.cnf` option file in the data directory, precede the variable name by the `PERSIST` keyword or the `@@PERSIST.` qualifier:

  ```
  SET PERSIST max_connections = 1000;
  SET @@PERSIST.max_connections = 1000;
  ```

  This `SET` syntax enables you to make configuration changes at runtime that also persist across server restarts. Like `SET GLOBAL`, `SET PERSIST` sets the global variable runtime value, but also writes the variable setting to the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file (replacing any existing variable setting if there is one).

* To persist a global system variable to the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file without setting the global variable runtime value, precede the variable name by the `PERSIST_ONLY` keyword or the `@@PERSIST_ONLY.` qualifier:

  ```
  SET PERSIST_ONLY back_log = 100;
  SET @@PERSIST_ONLY.back_log = 100;
  ```

  Like `PERSIST`, `PERSIST_ONLY` writes the variable setting to `mysqld-auto.cnf`. However, unlike `PERSIST`, `PERSIST_ONLY` does not modify the global variable runtime value. This makes `PERSIST_ONLY` suitable for configuring read-only system variables that can be set only at server startup.

To set a global system variable value to the compiled-in MySQL default value or a session system variable to the current corresponding global value, set the variable to the value `DEFAULT`. For example, the following two statements are identical in setting the session value of `max_join_size` to the current global value:

```
SET @@SESSION.max_join_size = DEFAULT;
SET @@SESSION.max_join_size = @@GLOBAL.max_join_size;
```

Using `SET` to persist a global system variable to a value of `DEFAULT` or to its literal default value assigns the variable its default value and adds a setting for the variable to `mysqld-auto.cnf`. To remove the variable from the file, use `RESET PERSIST`.

Some system variables cannot be persisted or are persist-restricted. See Section 7.1.9.4, “Nonpersistible and Persist-Restricted System Variables”.

A system variable implemented by a plugin can be persisted if the plugin is installed when the `SET` statement is executed. Assignment of the persisted plugin variable takes effect for subsequent server restarts if the plugin is still installed. If the plugin is no longer installed, the plugin variable no longer exists when the server reads the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file. In this case, the server writes a warning to the error log and continues:

```
currently unknown variable 'var_name'
was read from the persisted config file
```

To display system variable names and values:

* Use the `SHOW VARIABLES` statement; see Section 15.7.7.42, “SHOW VARIABLES Statement”.

* Several Performance Schema tables provide system variable information. See Section 29.12.14, “Performance Schema System Variable Tables”.

* The Performance Schema `variables_info` table contains information showing when and by which user each system variable was most recently set. See Section 29.12.14.3, “Performance Schema variables\_info Table”.

* The Performance Schema `persisted_variables` table provides an SQL interface to the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file, enabling its contents to be inspected at runtime using `SELECT` statements. See Section 29.12.14.2, “Performance Schema persisted\_variables Table”.

##### SET Error Handling

If any variable assignment in a `SET` statement fails, the entire statement fails and no variables are changed, nor is the `mysqld-auto.cnf` file changed.

`SET` produces an error under the circumstances described here. Most of the examples show `SET` statements that use keyword syntax (for example, `GLOBAL` or `SESSION`), but the principles are also true for statements that use the corresponding modifiers (for example, `@@GLOBAL.` or `@@SESSION.`).

* Use of `SET` (any variant) to set a read-only variable:

  ```
  mysql> SET GLOBAL version = 'abc';
  ERROR 1238 (HY000): Variable 'version' is a read only variable
  ```

* Use of `GLOBAL`, `PERSIST`, or `PERSIST_ONLY` to set a variable that has only a session value:

  ```
  mysql> SET GLOBAL sql_log_bin = ON;
  ERROR 1228 (HY000): Variable 'sql_log_bin' is a SESSION
  variable and can't be used with SET GLOBAL
  ```

* Use of `SESSION` to set a variable that has only a global value:

  ```
  mysql> SET SESSION max_connections = 1000;
  ERROR 1229 (HY000): Variable 'max_connections' is a
  GLOBAL variable and should be set with SET GLOBAL
  ```

* Omission of `GLOBAL`, `PERSIST`, or `PERSIST_ONLY` to set a variable that has only a global value:

  ```
  mysql> SET max_connections = 1000;
  ERROR 1229 (HY000): Variable 'max_connections' is a
  GLOBAL variable and should be set with SET GLOBAL
  ```

* Use of `PERSIST` or `PERSIST_ONLY` to set a variable that cannot be persisted:

  ```
  mysql> SET PERSIST port = 3307;
  ERROR 1238 (HY000): Variable 'port' is a read only variable
  mysql> SET PERSIST_ONLY port = 3307;
  ERROR 1238 (HY000): Variable 'port' is a non persistent read only variable
  ```

* The `@@GLOBAL.`, `@@PERSIST.`, `@@PERSIST_ONLY.`, `@@SESSION.`, and `@@` modifiers apply only to system variables. An error occurs for attempts to apply them to user-defined variables, stored procedure or function parameters, or stored program local variables.

* Not all system variables can be set to `DEFAULT`. In such cases, assigning `DEFAULT` results in an error.

* An error occurs for attempts to assign `DEFAULT` to user-defined variables, stored procedure or function parameters, or stored program local variables.

##### Multiple Variable Assignment

A `SET` statement can contain multiple variable assignments, separated by commas. This statement assigns values to a user-defined variable and a system variable:

```
SET @x = 1, SESSION sql_mode = '';
```

If you set multiple system variables in a single statement, the most recent `GLOBAL`, `PERSIST`, `PERSIST_ONLY`, or `SESSION` keyword in the statement is used for following assignments that have no keyword specified.

Examples of multiple-variable assignment:

```
SET GLOBAL sort_buffer_size = 1000000, SESSION sort_buffer_size = 1000000;
SET @@GLOBAL.sort_buffer_size = 1000000, @@LOCAL.sort_buffer_size = 1000000;
SET GLOBAL max_connections = 1000, sort_buffer_size = 1000000;
```

The `@@GLOBAL.`, `@@PERSIST.`, `@@PERSIST_ONLY.`, `@@SESSION.`, and `@@` modifiers apply only to the immediately following system variable, not any remaining system variables. This statement sets the `sort_buffer_size` global value to 50000 and the session value to 1000000:

```
SET @@GLOBAL.sort_buffer_size = 50000, sort_buffer_size = 1000000;
```

##### System Variable References in Expressions

To refer to the value of a system variable in expressions, use one of the `@@`-modifiers (except `@@PERSIST.` and `@@PERSIST_ONLY.`, which are not permitted in expressions). For example, you can retrieve system variable values in a `SELECT` statement like this:

```
SELECT @@GLOBAL.sql_mode, @@SESSION.sql_mode, @@sql_mode;
```

Note

A reference to a system variable in an expression as `@@var_name` (with `@@` rather than `@@GLOBAL.` or `@@SESSION.`) returns the session value if it exists and the global value otherwise. This differs from `SET @@var_name = expr`, which always refers to the session value.
