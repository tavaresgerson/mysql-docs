### 15.8.3 HELP Statement

```
HELP 'search_string'
```

The `HELP` statement returns online information from the MySQL Reference Manual. Its proper operation requires that the help tables in the `mysql` database be initialized with help topic information (see Section 7.1.17, “Server-Side Help Support”).

The `HELP` statement searches the help tables for the given search string and displays the result of the search. The search string is not case-sensitive.

The search string can contain the wildcard characters `%` and `_`. These have the same meaning as for pattern-matching operations performed with the `LIKE` operator. For example, `HELP 'rep%'` returns a list of topics that begin with `rep`.

The `HELP` statement does not require a terminator such as `;` or `\G`.

The `HELP` statement understands several types of search strings:

* At the most general level, use `contents` to retrieve a list of the top-level help categories:

  ```
  HELP 'contents'
  ```

* For a list of topics in a given help category, such as `Data Types`, use the category name:

  ```
  HELP 'data types'
  ```

* For help on a specific help topic, such as the `ASCII()` function or the `CREATE TABLE` statement, use the associated keyword or keywords:

  ```
  HELP 'ascii'
  HELP 'create table'
  ```

In other words, the search string matches a category, many topics, or a single topic. The following descriptions indicate the forms that the result set can take.

* Empty result

  No match could be found for the search string.

  Example: `HELP 'fake'`

  Yields:

  ```
  Nothing found
  Please try to run 'help contents' for a list of all accessible topics
  ```

* Result set containing a single row

  This means that the search string yielded a hit for the help topic. The result includes the following items:

  + `name`: The topic name.
  + `description`: Descriptive help text for the topic.

  + `example`: One or more usage examples. (May be empty.)

  Example: `HELP 'log'`

  Yields:

  ```
  Name: 'LOG'
  Description:
  Syntax:
  LOG(X), LOG(B,X)

  If called with one parameter, this function returns the natural
  logarithm of X. If X is less than or equal to 0.0E0, the function
  returns NULL and a warning "Invalid argument for logarithm" is
  reported. Returns NULL if X or B is NULL.

  The inverse of this function (when called with a single argument) is
  the EXP() function.

  Examples:
  mysql> SELECT LOG(2);
          -> 0.69314718055995
  mysql> SELECT LOG(-2);
          -> NULL
  ```

* List of topics.

  This means that the search string matched multiple help topics.

  Example: `HELP 'status'`

  Yields:

  ```
  Many help items for your request exist.
  To make a more specific request, please type 'help <item>',
  where <item> is one of the following topics:
     FLUSH
     SHOW
     SHOW BINARY LOG STATUS
     SHOW ENGINE
     SHOW FUNCTION STATUS
     SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS
     SHOW REPLICA STATUS
     SHOW STATUS
     SHOW TABLE STATUS
  ```

* List of topics.

  A list is also displayed if the search string matches a category.

  Example: `HELP 'functions'`

  Yields:

  ```
