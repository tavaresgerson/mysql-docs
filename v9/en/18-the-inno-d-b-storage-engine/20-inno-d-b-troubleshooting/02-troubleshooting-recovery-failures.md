### 17.20.2 Troubleshooting Recovery Failures

Checkpoints and advancing the checkpoint LSN are not permitted until redo log recovery is complete and data dictionary dynamic metadata (`srv_dict_metadata`) is transferred to data dictionary table (`dict_table_t`) objects. Should the redo log run out of space during recovery or after recovery (but before data dictionary dynamic metadata is transferred to data dictionary table objects) as a result of this change, an `innodb_force_recovery` restart may be required, starting with at least the `SRV_FORCE_NO_IBUF_MERGE` setting or, in case that fails, the `SRV_FORCE_NO_LOG_REDO` setting. If an `innodb_force_recovery` restart fails in this scenario, recovery from backup may be necessary.
