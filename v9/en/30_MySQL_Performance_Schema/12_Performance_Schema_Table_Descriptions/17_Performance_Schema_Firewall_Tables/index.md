### 29.12.17 Performance Schema Firewall Tables

29.12.17.1 The firewall\_groups Table

29.12.17.2 The firewall\_group\_allowlist Table

29.12.17.3 The firewall\_membership Table

The following sections describe the Performance Schema tables associated with MySQL Enterprise Firewall (see Section 8.4.8, “MySQL Enterprise Firewall”). They provide information about firewall operation:

* `firewall_groups`: Information about firewall group profiles.

* `firewall_group_allowlist`: Allowlist rules of registered firewall group profiles.

* `firewall_membership`: Members (accounts) of registered firewall group profiles.

These tables are supported by both the firewall plugin (deprecated) and the MySQL Enterprise Firewall component.
