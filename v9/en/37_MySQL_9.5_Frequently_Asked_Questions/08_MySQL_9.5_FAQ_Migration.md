## A.8 MySQL 9.5 FAQ: Migration

A.8.1. Where can I find information on how to upgrade or downgrade MySQL?

<table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td><p><b>A.8.1.</b></p></td><td><p> Where can I find information on how to upgrade or downgrade MySQL? </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> For detailed upgrade information, see Chapter 3, <i>Upgrading MySQL</i>. Do not skip a major version when upgrading, but rather complete the process in steps, upgrading from one major version to the next in each step. This may seem more complicated, but ultimately saves time and trouble. If you encounter problems during the upgrade, their origin is easier to identify, either by you or, if you have a MySQL Enterprise subscription, by MySQL support. </p></td></tr></tbody></table>
