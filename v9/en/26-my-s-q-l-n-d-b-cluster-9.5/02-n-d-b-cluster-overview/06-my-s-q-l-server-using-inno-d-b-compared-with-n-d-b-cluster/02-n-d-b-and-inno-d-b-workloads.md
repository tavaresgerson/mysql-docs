#### 25.2.6.2 NDB and InnoDB Workloads

NDB Cluster has a range of unique attributes that make it ideal to serve applications requiring high availability, fast failover, high throughput, and low latency. Due to its distributed architecture and multi-node implementation, NDB Cluster also has specific constraints that may keep some workloads from performing well. A number of major differences in behavior between the `NDB` and `InnoDB` storage engines with regard to some common types of database-driven application workloads are shown in the following table::

**Table 25.2 Differences between InnoDB and NDB storage engines, common types of data-driven application workloads.**
