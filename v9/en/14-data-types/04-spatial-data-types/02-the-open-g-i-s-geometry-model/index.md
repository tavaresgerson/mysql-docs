The set of geometry types proposed by OGC's **SQL with Geometry Types** environment is based on the **OpenGIS Geometry Model**. In this model, each geometric object has the following general properties:

* It is associated with a spatial reference system, which describes the coordinate space in which the object is defined.

* It belongs to some geometry class.
