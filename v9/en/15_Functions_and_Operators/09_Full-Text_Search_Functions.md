MySQL has support for full-text indexing and searching:

* A full-text index in MySQL is an index of type `FULLTEXT`.

* Full-text indexes can be used only with `InnoDB` or `MyISAM` tables, and can be created only for `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, or `TEXT` columns.

* MySQL provides a built-in full-text ngram parser that supports Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), and an installable MeCab full-text parser plugin for Japanese. Parsing differences are outlined in Section 14.9.8, “ngram Full-Text Parser”, and Section 14.9.9, “MeCab Full-Text Parser Plugin”.

* A `FULLTEXT` index definition can be given in the `CREATE TABLE` statement when a table is created, or added later using `ALTER TABLE` or `CREATE INDEX`.

* For large data sets, it is much faster to load your data into a table that has no `FULLTEXT` index and then create the index after that, than to load data into a table that has an existing `FULLTEXT` index.

Full-text searching is performed using `MATCH() AGAINST()` syntax. `MATCH()` takes a comma-separated list that names the columns to be searched. `AGAINST` takes a string to search for, and an optional modifier that indicates what type of search to perform. The search string must be a string value that is constant during query evaluation. This rules out, for example, a table column because that can differ for each row.

MySQL does not permit the use of a rollup column with `MATCH()`; more specifically, any query matching all of the criteria listed here is rejected with `ER_FULLTEXT_WITH_ROLLUP`:

* `MATCH()` appears in the `SELECT` list, `GROUP BY` clause, `HAVING` clause, or `ORDER BY` clause of a query block.

* The query block contains a `GROUP BY ... WITH ROLLUP` clause.

* The argument of the call to the `MATCH()` function is one of the grouping columns.

Some examples of such queries are shown here:

```
# MATCH() in SELECT list...
SELECT MATCH (a) AGAINST ('abc') FROM t GROUP BY a WITH ROLLUP;
SELECT 1 FROM t GROUP BY a, MATCH (a) AGAINST ('abc') WITH ROLLUP;

# ...in HAVING clause...
SELECT 1 FROM t GROUP BY a WITH ROLLUP HAVING MATCH (a) AGAINST ('abc');

# ...and in ORDER BY clause
SELECT 1 FROM t GROUP BY a WITH ROLLUP ORDER BY MATCH (a) AGAINST ('abc');
```

The use of `MATCH()` with a rollup column in the `WHERE` clause is permitted.

There are three types of full-text searches:

* A natural language search interprets the search string as a phrase in natural human language (a phrase in free text). There are no special operators, with the exception of double quote (") characters. The stopword list applies. For more information about stopword lists, see Section 14.9.4, “Full-Text Stopwords”.

  Full-text searches are natural language searches if the `IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE` modifier is given or if no modifier is given. For more information, see Section 14.9.1, “Natural Language Full-Text Searches”.

* A boolean search interprets the search string using the rules of a special query language. The string contains the words to search for. It can also contain operators that specify requirements such that a word must be present or absent in matching rows, or that it should be weighted higher or lower than usual. Certain common words (stopwords) are omitted from the search index and do not match if present in the search string. The `IN BOOLEAN MODE` modifier specifies a boolean search. For more information, see Section 14.9.2, “Boolean Full-Text Searches”.

* A query expansion search is a modification of a natural language search. The search string is used to perform a natural language search. Then words from the most relevant rows returned by the search are added to the search string and the search is done again. The query returns the rows from the second search. The `IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE WITH QUERY EXPANSION` or `WITH QUERY EXPANSION` modifier specifies a query expansion search. For more information, see Section 14.9.3, “Full-Text Searches with Query Expansion”.

For information about `FULLTEXT` query performance, see Section 10.3.5, “Column Indexes”.

For more information about `InnoDB` `FULLTEXT` indexes, see Section 17.6.2.4, “InnoDB Full-Text Indexes”.

Constraints on full-text searching are listed in Section 14.9.5, “Full-Text Restrictions”.

The **myisam_ftdump** utility dumps the contents of a `MyISAM` full-text index. This may be helpful for debugging full-text queries. See Section 6.6.3, “myisam_ftdump — Display Full-Text Index information”.


### 14.9.1 Natural Language Full-Text Searches

By default or with the `IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE` modifier, the `MATCH()` function performs a natural language search for a string against a text collection. A collection is a set of one or more columns included in a `FULLTEXT` index. The search string is given as the argument to `AGAINST()`. For each row in the table, `MATCH()` returns a relevance value; that is, a similarity measure between the search string and the text in that row in the columns named in the `MATCH()` list.

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE articles (
    ->   id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    ->   title VARCHAR(200),
    ->   body TEXT,
    ->   FULLTEXT (title,body)
    -> ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO articles (title,body) VALUES
    ->   ('MySQL Tutorial','DBMS stands for DataBase ...'),
    ->   ('How To Use MySQL Well','After you went through a ...'),
    ->   ('Optimizing MySQL','In this tutorial, we show ...'),
    ->   ('1001 MySQL Tricks','1. Never run mysqld as root. 2. ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL vs. YourSQL','In the following database comparison ...'),
    ->   ('MySQL Security','When configured properly, MySQL ...');
Query OK, 6 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 6  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> SELECT * FROM articles
    -> WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('database' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
+----+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
| id | title             | body                                     |
+----+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
|  1 | MySQL Tutorial    | DBMS stands for DataBase ...             |
|  5 | MySQL vs. YourSQL | In the following database comparison ... |
+----+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

By default, the search is performed in case-insensitive fashion. To perform a case-sensitive full-text search, use a case-sensitive or binary collation for the indexed columns. For example, a column that uses the `utf8mb4` character set of can be assigned a collation of `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` or `utf8mb4_bin` to make it case-sensitive for full-text searches.

When `MATCH()` is used in a `WHERE` clause, as in the example shown earlier, the rows returned are automatically sorted with the highest relevance first as long as the following conditions are met:

* There must be no explicit `ORDER BY` clause.

* The search must be performed using a full-text index scan rather than a table scan.

* If the query joins tables, the full-text index scan must be the leftmost non-constant table in the join.

Given the conditions just listed, it is usually less effort to specify using `ORDER BY` an explicit sort order when one is necessary or desired.

Relevance values are nonnegative floating-point numbers. Zero relevance means no similarity. Relevance is computed based on the number of words in the row (document), the number of unique words in the row, the total number of words in the collection, and the number of rows that contain a particular word.

Note

The term “document” may be used interchangeably with the term “row”, and both terms refer to the indexed part of the row. The term “collection” refers to the indexed columns and encompasses all rows.

To simply count matches, you could use a query like this:

```
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles
    -> WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('database' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        2 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

You might find it quicker to rewrite the query as follows:

```
mysql> SELECT
    -> COUNT(IF(MATCH (title,body) AGAINST ('database' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE), 1, NULL))
    -> AS count
    -> FROM articles;
+-------+
| count |
+-------+
|     2 |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

The first query does some extra work (sorting the results by relevance) but also can use an index lookup based on the `WHERE` clause. The index lookup might make the first query faster if the search matches few rows. The second query performs a full table scan, which might be faster than the index lookup if the search term was present in most rows.

For natural-language full-text searches, the columns named in the `MATCH()` function must be the same columns included in some `FULLTEXT` index in your table. For the preceding query, note that the columns named in the `MATCH()` function (`title` and `body`) are the same as those named in the definition of the `article` table's `FULLTEXT` index. To search the `title` or `body` separately, you would create separate `FULLTEXT` indexes for each column.

You can also perform a boolean search or a search with query expansion. These search types are described in Section 14.9.2, “Boolean Full-Text Searches”, and Section 14.9.3, “Full-Text Searches with Query Expansion”.

A full-text search that uses an index can name columns only from a single table in the `MATCH()` clause because an index cannot span multiple tables. For `MyISAM` tables, a boolean search can be done in the absence of an index (albeit more slowly), in which case it is possible to name columns from multiple tables.

The preceding example is a basic illustration that shows how to use the `MATCH()` function where rows are returned in order of decreasing relevance. The next example shows how to retrieve the relevance values explicitly. Returned rows are not ordered because the `SELECT` statement includes neither `WHERE` nor `ORDER BY` clauses:

```
mysql> SELECT id, MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('Tutorial' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE) AS score
    -> FROM articles;
+----+---------------------+
| id | score               |
+----+---------------------+
|  1 | 0.22764469683170319 |
|  2 |                   0 |
|  3 | 0.22764469683170319 |
|  4 |                   0 |
|  5 |                   0 |
|  6 |                   0 |
+----+---------------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The following example is more complex. The query returns the relevance values and it also sorts the rows in order of decreasing relevance. To achieve this result, specify `MATCH()` twice: once in the `SELECT` list and once in the `WHERE` clause. This causes no additional overhead, because the MySQL optimizer notices that the two `MATCH()` calls are identical and invokes the full-text search code only once.

```
mysql> SELECT id, body, MATCH (title,body)
    ->   AGAINST ('Security implications of running MySQL as root'
    ->   IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE) AS score
    -> FROM articles
    ->   WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    ->   AGAINST('Security implications of running MySQL as root'
    ->   IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
+----+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
| id | body                                | score           |
+----+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
|  4 | 1. Never run mysqld as root. 2. ... | 1.5219271183014 |
|  6 | When configured properly, MySQL ... | 1.3114095926285 |
+----+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

A phrase that is enclosed within double quote (`"`) characters matches only rows that contain the phrase *literally, as it was typed*. The full-text engine splits the phrase into words and performs a search in the `FULLTEXT` index for the words. Nonword characters need not be matched exactly: Phrase searching requires only that matches contain exactly the same words as the phrase and in the same order. For example, `"test phrase"` matches `"test, phrase"`. If the phrase contains no words that are in the index, the result is empty. For example, if all words are either stopwords or shorter than the minimum length of indexed words, the result is empty.

The MySQL `FULLTEXT` implementation regards any sequence of true word characters (letters, digits, and underscores) as a word. That sequence may also contain apostrophes (`'`), but not more than one in a row. This means that `aaa'bbb` is regarded as one word, but `aaa''bbb` is regarded as two words. Apostrophes at the beginning or the end of a word are stripped by the `FULLTEXT` parser; `'aaa'bbb'` would be parsed as `aaa'bbb`.

The built-in `FULLTEXT` parser determines where words start and end by looking for certain delimiter characters; for example,  (space), `,` (comma), and `.` (period). If words are not separated by delimiters (as in, for example, Chinese), the built-in `FULLTEXT` parser cannot determine where a word begins or ends. To be able to add words or other indexed terms in such languages to a `FULLTEXT` index that uses the built-in `FULLTEXT` parser, you must preprocess them so that they are separated by some arbitrary delimiter. Alternatively, you can create `FULLTEXT` indexes using the ngram parser plugin (for Chinese, Japanese, or Korean) or the MeCab parser plugin (for Japanese).

It is possible to write a plugin that replaces the built-in full-text parser. For details, see The MySQL Plugin API. For example parser plugin source code, see the `plugin/fulltext` directory of a MySQL source distribution.

Some words are ignored in full-text searches:

* Any word that is too short is ignored. The default minimum length of words that are found by full-text searches is three characters for `InnoDB` search indexes, or four characters for `MyISAM`. You can control the cutoff by setting a configuration option before creating the index: `innodb_ft_min_token_size` configuration option for `InnoDB` search indexes, or `ft_min_word_len` for `MyISAM`.

  Note

  This behavior does not apply to `FULLTEXT` indexes that use the ngram parser. For the ngram parser, token length is defined by the `ngram_token_size` option.

* Words in the stopword list are ignored. A stopword is a word such as “the” or “some” that is so common that it is considered to have zero semantic value. There is a built-in stopword list, but it can be overridden by a user-defined list. The stopword lists and related configuration options are different for `InnoDB` search indexes and `MyISAM` ones. Stopword processing is controlled by the configuration options `innodb_ft_enable_stopword`, `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`, and `innodb_ft_user_stopword_table` for `InnoDB` search indexes, and `ft_stopword_file` for `MyISAM` ones.

See Section 14.9.4, “Full-Text Stopwords” to view default stopword lists and how to change them. The default minimum word length can be changed as described in Section 14.9.6, “Fine-Tuning MySQL Full-Text Search”.

Every correct word in the collection and in the query is weighted according to its significance in the collection or query. Thus, a word that is present in many documents has a lower weight, because it has lower semantic value in this particular collection. Conversely, if the word is rare, it receives a higher weight. The weights of the words are combined to compute the relevance of the row. This technique works best with large collections.

MyISAM Limitation

For very small tables, word distribution does not adequately reflect their semantic value, and this model may sometimes produce bizarre results for search indexes on `MyISAM` tables. For example, although the word “MySQL” is present in every row of the `articles` table shown earlier, a search for the word in a `MyISAM` search index produces no results:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles
    -> WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('MySQL' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

The search result is empty because the word “MySQL” is present in at least 50% of the rows, and so is effectively treated as a stopword. This filtering technique is more suitable for large data sets, where you might not want the result set to return every second row from a 1GB table, than for small data sets where it might cause poor results for popular terms.

The 50% threshold can surprise you when you first try full-text searching to see how it works, and makes `InnoDB` tables more suited to experimentation with full-text searches. If you create a `MyISAM` table and insert only one or two rows of text into it, every word in the text occurs in at least 50% of the rows. As a result, no search returns any results until the table contains more rows. Users who need to bypass the 50% limitation can build search indexes on `InnoDB` tables, or use the boolean search mode explained in Section 14.9.2, “Boolean Full-Text Searches”.


### 14.9.2 Boolean Full-Text Searches

MySQL can perform boolean full-text searches using the `IN BOOLEAN MODE` modifier. With this modifier, certain characters have special meaning at the beginning or end of words in the search string. In the following query, the `+` and `-` operators indicate that a word must be present or absent, respectively, for a match to occur. Thus, the query retrieves all the rows that contain the word “MySQL” but that do *not* contain the word “YourSQL”:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    -> AGAINST ('+MySQL -YourSQL' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
+----+-----------------------+-------------------------------------+
| id | title                 | body                                |

```

Note

In implementing this feature, MySQL uses what is sometimes referred to as implied Boolean logic, in which

* `+` stands for `AND`
* `-` stands for `NOT`
* [*no operator*] implies `OR`

Boolean full-text searches have these characteristics:

* They do not automatically sort rows in order of decreasing relevance.

* `InnoDB` tables require a `FULLTEXT` index on all columns of the `MATCH()` expression to perform boolean queries. Boolean queries against a `MyISAM` search index can work even without a `FULLTEXT` index, although a search executed in this fashion would be quite slow.

* The minimum and maximum word length full-text parameters apply to `FULLTEXT` indexes created using the built-in `FULLTEXT` parser and MeCab parser plugin. `innodb_ft_min_token_size` and `innodb_ft_max_token_size` are used for `InnoDB` search indexes. `ft_min_word_len` and `ft_max_word_len` are used for `MyISAM` search indexes.

  Minimum and maximum word length full-text parameters do not apply to `FULLTEXT` indexes created using the ngram parser. ngram token size is defined by the `ngram_token_size` option.

* The stopword list applies, controlled by `innodb_ft_enable_stopword`, `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`, and `innodb_ft_user_stopword_table` for `InnoDB` search indexes, and `ft_stopword_file` for `MyISAM` ones.

* `InnoDB` full-text search does not support the use of multiple operators on a single search word, as in this example: `'++apple'`. Use of multiple operators on a single search word returns a syntax error to standard out. MyISAM full-text search successfully processes the same search, ignoring all operators except for the operator immediately adjacent to the search word.

* `InnoDB` full-text search only supports leading plus or minus signs. For example, `InnoDB` supports `'+apple'` but does not support `'apple+'`. Specifying a trailing plus or minus sign causes `InnoDB` to report a syntax error.

* `InnoDB` full-text search does not support the use of a leading plus sign with wildcard (`'+*'`), a plus and minus sign combination (`'+-'`), or leading a plus and minus sign combination (`'+-apple'`). These invalid queries return a syntax error.

* `InnoDB` full-text search does not support the use of the `@` symbol in boolean full-text searches. The `@` symbol is reserved for use by the `@distance` proximity search operator.

* They do not use the 50% threshold that applies to `MyISAM` search indexes.

The boolean full-text search capability supports the following operators:

* `+`

  A leading or trailing plus sign indicates that this word *must* be present in each row that is returned. `InnoDB` only supports leading plus signs.

* `-`

  A leading or trailing minus sign indicates that this word must *not* be present in any of the rows that are returned. `InnoDB` only supports leading minus signs.

  Note: The `-` operator acts only to exclude rows that are otherwise matched by other search terms. Thus, a boolean-mode search that contains only terms preceded by `-` returns an empty result. It does not return “all rows except those containing any of the excluded terms.”

* (no operator)

  By default (when neither `+` nor `-` is specified), the word is optional, but the rows that contain it are rated higher. This mimics the behavior of [`MATCH() AGAINST()`](fulltext-search.html#function_match) without the `IN BOOLEAN MODE` modifier.

* `@distance`

  This operator works on `InnoDB` tables only. It tests whether two or more words all start within a specified distance from each other, measured in words. Specify the search words within a double-quoted string immediately before the `@distance` operator, for example, `MATCH(col1) AGAINST('"word1 word2 word3" @8' IN BOOLEAN MODE)`

* `> <`

  These two operators are used to change a word's contribution to the relevance value that is assigned to a row. The `>` operator increases the contribution and the `<` operator decreases it. See the example following this list.

* `( )`

  Parentheses group words into subexpressions. Parenthesized groups can be nested.

* `~`

  A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's contribution to the row's relevance to be negative. This is useful for marking “noise” words. A row containing such a word is rated lower than others, but is not excluded altogether, as it would be with the `-` operator.

* `*`

  The asterisk serves as the truncation (or wildcard) operator. Unlike the other operators, it is *appended* to the word to be affected. Words match if they begin with the word preceding the `*` operator.

  If a word is specified with the truncation operator, it is not stripped from a boolean query, even if it is too short or a stopword. Whether a word is too short is determined from the `innodb_ft_min_token_size` setting for `InnoDB` tables, or `ft_min_word_len` for `MyISAM` tables. These options are not applicable to `FULLTEXT` indexes that use the ngram parser.

  The wildcarded word is considered as a prefix that must be present at the start of one or more words. If the minimum word length is 4, a search for `'+word +the*'` could return fewer rows than a search for `'+word +the'`, because the second query ignores the too-short search term `the`.

* `"`

  A phrase that is enclosed within double quote (`"`) characters matches only rows that contain the phrase *literally, as it was typed*. The full-text engine splits the phrase into words and performs a search in the `FULLTEXT` index for the words. Nonword characters need not be matched exactly: Phrase searching requires only that matches contain exactly the same words as the phrase and in the same order. For example, `"test phrase"` matches `"test, phrase"`.

  If the phrase contains no words that are in the index, the result is empty. The words might not be in the index because of a combination of factors: if they do not exist in the text, are stopwords, or are shorter than the minimum length of indexed words.

The following examples demonstrate some search strings that use boolean full-text operators:

* `'apple banana'`

  Find rows that contain at least one of the two words.

* `'+apple +juice'`

  Find rows that contain both words.

* `'+apple macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple”, but rank rows higher if they also contain “macintosh”.

* `'+apple -macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple” but not “macintosh”.

* `'+apple ~macintosh'`

  Find rows that contain the word “apple”, but if the row also contains the word “macintosh”, rate it lower than if row does not. This is “softer” than a search for `'+apple -macintosh'`, for which the presence of “macintosh” causes the row not to be returned at all.

* `'+apple +(>turnover <strudel)'`

  Find rows that contain the words “apple” and “turnover”, or “apple” and “strudel” (in any order), but rank “apple turnover” higher than “apple strudel”.

* `'apple*'`

  Find rows that contain words such as “apple”, “apples”, “applesauce”, or “applet”.

* `'"some words"'`

  Find rows that contain the exact phrase “some words” (for example, rows that contain “some words of wisdom” but not “some noise words”). Note that the `"` characters that enclose the phrase are operator characters that delimit the phrase. They are not the quotation marks that enclose the search string itself.

#### Relevancy Rankings for InnoDB Boolean Mode Search

`InnoDB` full-text search is modeled on the Sphinx full-text search engine, and the algorithms used are based on BM25 and TF-IDF ranking algorithms. For these reasons, relevancy rankings for `InnoDB` boolean full-text search may differ from `MyISAM` relevancy rankings.

`InnoDB` uses a variation of the “term frequency-inverse document frequency” (`TF-IDF`) weighting system to rank a document's relevance for a given full-text search query. The `TF-IDF` weighting is based on how frequently a word appears in a document, offset by how frequently the word appears in all documents in the collection. In other words, the more frequently a word appears in a document, and the less frequently the word appears in the document collection, the higher the document is ranked.

##### How Relevancy Ranking is Calculated

The term frequency (`TF`) value is the number of times that a word appears in a document. The inverse document frequency (`IDF`) value of a word is calculated using the following formula, where `total_records` is the number of records in the collection, and `matching_records` is the number of records that the search term appears in.

```
${IDF} = log10( ${total_records} / ${matching_records} )
```

When a document contains a word multiple times, the IDF value is multiplied by the TF value:

```
${TF} * ${IDF}
```

Using the `TF` and `IDF` values, the relevancy ranking for a document is calculated using this formula:

```
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

The formula is demonstrated in the following examples.

##### Relevancy Ranking for a Single Word Search

This example demonstrates the relevancy ranking calculation for a single-word search.

There are 8 records in total, with 3 that match the “database” search term. The first record (`id 6`) contains the search term 6 times and has a relevancy ranking of `1.0886961221694946`. This ranking value is calculated using a `TF` value of 6 (the “database” search term appears 6 times in record `id 6`) and an `IDF` value of 0.42596873216370745, which is calculated as follows (where 8 is the total number of records and 3 is the number of records that the search term appears in):

```
${IDF} = LOG10( 8 / 3 ) = 0.42596873216370745
```

The `TF` and `IDF` values are then entered into the ranking formula:

```
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

Performing the calculation in the MySQL command-line client returns a ranking value of 1.088696164686938.

```
mysql> SELECT 6*LOG10(8/3)*LOG10(8/3);
+-------------------------+
| 6*LOG10(8/3)*LOG10(8/3) |
+-------------------------+
|       1.088696164686938 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note

You may notice a slight difference in the ranking values returned by the `SELECT ... MATCH ... AGAINST` statement and the MySQL command-line client (`1.0886961221694946` versus `1.088696164686938`). The difference is due to how the casts between integers and floats/doubles are performed internally by `InnoDB` (along with related precision and rounding decisions), and how they are performed elsewhere, such as in the MySQL command-line client or other types of calculators.

##### Relevancy Ranking for a Multiple Word Search

This example demonstrates the relevancy ranking calculation for a multiple-word full-text search based on the `articles` table and data used in the previous example.

If you search on more than one word, the relevancy ranking value is a sum of the relevancy ranking value for each word, as shown in this formula:

```
${rank} = ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF} + ${TF} * ${IDF} * ${IDF}
```

Performing a search on two terms ('mysql tutorial') returns the following results:

```
mysql> SELECT id, title, body, MATCH (title,body)
    ->   AGAINST ('mysql tutorial' IN BOOLEAN MODE) AS score
    ->   FROM articles ORDER BY score DESC;
+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------+
| id | title                        | body                                | score                |

+----+------------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------+
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

In the first record (`id 8`), 'mysql' appears once and 'tutorial' appears twice. There are six matching records for 'mysql' and two matching records for 'tutorial'. The MySQL command-line client returns the expected ranking value when inserting these values into the ranking formula for a multiple word search:

```
mysql> SELECT (1*log10(8/6)*log10(8/6)) + (2*log10(8/2)*log10(8/2));
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| (1*log10(8/6)*log10(8/6)) + (2*log10(8/2)*log10(8/2)) |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                                    0.7405621541938003 |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Note

The slight difference in the ranking values returned by the `SELECT ... MATCH ... AGAINST` statement and the MySQL command-line client is explained in the preceding example.


### 14.9.3 Full-Text Searches with Query Expansion

Full-text search supports query expansion (and in particular, its variant “blind query expansion”). This is generally useful when a search phrase is too short, which often means that the user is relying on implied knowledge that the full-text search engine lacks. For example, a user searching for “database” may really mean that “MySQL”, “Oracle”, “DB2”, and “RDBMS” all are phrases that should match “databases” and should be returned, too. This is implied knowledge.

Blind query expansion (also known as automatic relevance feedback) is enabled by adding `WITH QUERY EXPANSION` or `IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE WITH QUERY EXPANSION` following the search phrase. It works by performing the search twice, where the search phrase for the second search is the original search phrase concatenated with the few most highly relevant documents from the first search. Thus, if one of these documents contains the word “databases” and the word “MySQL”, the second search finds the documents that contain the word “MySQL” even if they do not contain the word “database”. The following example shows this difference:

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM articles
    WHERE MATCH (title,body)
    AGAINST ('database' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
+----+-------------------+------------------------------------------+
| id | title             | body                                     |

+----+-----------------------+------------------------------------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Another example could be searching for books by Georges Simenon about Maigret, when a user is not sure how to spell “Maigret”. A search for “Megre and the reluctant witnesses” finds only “Maigret and the Reluctant Witnesses” without query expansion. A search with query expansion finds all books with the word “Maigret” on the second pass.

Note

Because blind query expansion tends to increase noise significantly by returning nonrelevant documents, use it only when a search phrase is short.


### 14.9.4 Full-Text Stopwords

The stopword list is loaded and searched for full-text queries using the server character set and collation (the values of the `character_set_server` and `collation_server` system variables). False hits or misses might occur for stopword lookups if the stopword file or columns used for full-text indexing or searches have a character set or collation different from `character_set_server` or `collation_server`.

Case sensitivity of stopword lookups depends on the server collation. For example, lookups are case-insensitive if the collation is `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`, whereas lookups are case-sensitive if the collation is `utf8mb4_0900_as_cs` or `utf8mb4_bin`.

* Stopwords for InnoDB Search Indexes
* Stopwords for MyISAM Search Indexes

#### Stopwords for InnoDB Search Indexes

`InnoDB` has a relatively short list of default stopwords, because documents from technical, literary, and other sources often use short words as keywords or in significant phrases. For example, you might search for “to be or not to be” and expect to get a sensible result, rather than having all those words ignored.

To see the default `InnoDB` stopword list, query the Information Schema `INNODB_FT_DEFAULT_STOPWORD` table.

```
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_DEFAULT_STOPWORD;
+-------+
| value |
+-------+
| a     |
| about |
| an    |
| are   |
| as    |
| at    |
| be    |
| by    |
| com   |
| de    |
| en    |
| for   |
| from  |
| how   |
| i     |
| in    |
| is    |
| it    |
| la    |
| of    |
| on    |
| or    |
| that  |
| the   |
| this  |
| to    |
| was   |
| what  |
| when  |
| where |
| who   |
| will  |
| with  |
| und   |
| the   |
| www   |
+-------+
36 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

To define your own stopword list for all `InnoDB` tables, define a table with the same structure as the `INNODB_FT_DEFAULT_STOPWORD` table, populate it with stopwords, and set the value of the `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table` option to a value in the form `db_name/table_name` before creating the full-text index. The stopword table must have a single `VARCHAR` column named `value`. The following example demonstrates creating and configuring a new global stopword table for `InnoDB`.

```
-- Create a new stopword table

mysql> CREATE TABLE my_stopwords(value VARCHAR(30)) ENGINE = INNODB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

-- Insert stopwords (for simplicity, a single stopword is used in this example)

mysql> INSERT INTO my_stopwords(value) VALUES ('Ishmael');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

-- Create the table

mysql> CREATE TABLE opening_lines (
id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
opening_line TEXT(500),
author VARCHAR(200),
title VARCHAR(200)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

-- Insert data into the table

mysql> INSERT INTO opening_lines(opening_line,author,title) VALUES
('Call me Ishmael.','Herman Melville','Moby-Dick'),
('A screaming comes across the sky.','Thomas Pynchon','Gravity\'s Rainbow'),
('I am an invisible man.','Ralph Ellison','Invisible Man'),
('Where now? Who now? When now?','Samuel Beckett','The Unnamable'),
('It was love at first sight.','Joseph Heller','Catch-22'),
('All this happened, more or less.','Kurt Vonnegut','Slaughterhouse-Five'),
('Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.','Virginia Woolf','Mrs. Dalloway'),
('It was a pleasure to burn.','Ray Bradbury','Fahrenheit 451');
Query OK, 8 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 8  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

-- Set the innodb_ft_server_stopword_table option to the new stopword table

mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_ft_server_stopword_table = 'test/my_stopwords';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

-- Create the full-text index (which rebuilds the table if no FTS_DOC_ID column is defined)

mysql> CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx ON opening_lines(opening_line);
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (1.17 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 1
```

Verify that the specified stopword ('Ishmael') does not appear by querying the Information Schema `INNODB_FT_INDEX_TABLE` table.

Note

By default, words less than 3 characters in length or greater than 84 characters in length do not appear in an `InnoDB` full-text search index. Maximum and minimum word length values are configurable using the `innodb_ft_max_token_size` and `innodb_ft_min_token_size` variables. This default behavior does not apply to the ngram parser plugin. ngram token size is defined by the `ngram_token_size` option.

```
mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_ft_aux_table='test/opening_lines';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT word FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_INDEX_TABLE LIMIT 15;
+-----------+
| word      |
+-----------+
| across    |
| all       |
| burn      |
| buy       |
| call      |
| comes     |
| dalloway  |
| first     |
| flowers   |
| happened  |
| herself   |
| invisible |
| less      |
| love      |
| man       |
+-----------+
15 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

To create stopword lists on a table-by-table basis, create other stopword tables and use the `innodb_ft_user_stopword_table` option to specify the stopword table that you want to use before you create the full-text index.

#### Stopwords for MyISAM Search Indexes

The stopword file is loaded and searched using `latin1` if `character_set_server` is `ucs2`, `utf16`, `utf16le`, or `utf32`.

To override the default stopword list for MyISAM tables, set the `ft_stopword_file` system variable. (See Section 7.1.8, “Server System Variables”.) The variable value should be the path name of the file containing the stopword list, or the empty string to disable stopword filtering. The server looks for the file in the data directory unless an absolute path name is given to specify a different directory. After changing the value of this variable or the contents of the stopword file, restart the server and rebuild your `FULLTEXT` indexes.

The stopword list is free-form, separating stopwords with any nonalphanumeric character such as newline, space, or comma. Exceptions are the underscore character (`_`) and a single apostrophe (`'`) which are treated as part of a word. The character set of the stopword list is the server's default character set; see Section 12.3.2, “Server Character Set and Collation”.

The following list shows the default stopwords for `MyISAM` search indexes. In a MySQL source distribution, you can find this list in the `storage/myisam/ft_static.c` file.

### 14.9.5 Full-Text Restrictions

* Full-text searches are supported for `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` tables only.

* Full-text searches are not supported for partitioned tables. See Section 26.6, “Restrictions and Limitations on Partitioning”.

* Full-text searches can be used with most multibyte character sets. The exception is that for Unicode, the `utf8mb3` or `utf8mb4` character set can be used, but not the `ucs2` character set. Although `FULLTEXT` indexes on `ucs2` columns cannot be used, you can perform `IN BOOLEAN MODE` searches on a `ucs2` column that has no such index.

  The remarks for `utf8mb3` also apply to `utf8mb4`, and the remarks for `ucs2` also apply to `utf16`, `utf16le`, and `utf32`.

* Ideographic languages such as Chinese and Japanese do not have word delimiters. Therefore, the built-in full-text parser *cannot determine where words begin and end in these and other such languages*.

  A character-based ngram full-text parser that supports Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK), and a word-based MeCab parser plugin that supports Japanese are provided for use with `InnoDB` and `MyISAM` tables.

* Although the use of multiple character sets within a single table is supported, all columns in a `FULLTEXT` index must use the same character set and collation.

* The `MATCH()` column list must match exactly the column list in some `FULLTEXT` index definition for the table, unless this `MATCH()` is `IN BOOLEAN MODE` on a `MyISAM` table. For `MyISAM` tables, boolean-mode searches can be done on nonindexed columns, although they are likely to be slow.

* The argument to `AGAINST()` must be a string value that is constant during query evaluation. This rules out, for example, a table column because that can differ for each row.

  The argument to `MATCH()` cannot use a rollup column.

* Index hints are more limited for `FULLTEXT` searches than for non-`FULLTEXT` searches. See Section 10.9.4, “Index Hints”.

* For `InnoDB`, all DML operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) involving columns with full-text indexes are processed at transaction commit time. For example, for an `INSERT` operation, an inserted string is tokenized and decomposed into individual words. The individual words are then added to full-text index tables when the transaction is committed. As a result, full-text searches only return committed data.

* The '%' character is not a supported wildcard character for full-text searches.


### 14.9.6 Fine-Tuning MySQL Full-Text Search

MySQL's full-text search capability has few user-tunable parameters. You can exert more control over full-text searching behavior if you have a MySQL source distribution because some changes require source code modifications. See Section 2.8, “Installing MySQL from Source”.

Full-text search is carefully tuned for effectiveness. Modifying the default behavior in most cases can actually decrease effectiveness. *Do not alter the MySQL sources unless you know what you are doing*.

Most full-text variables described in this section must be set at server startup time. A server restart is required to change them; they cannot be modified while the server is running.

Some variable changes require that you rebuild the `FULLTEXT` indexes in your tables. Instructions for doing so are given later in this section.

* Configuring Minimum and Maximum Word Length
* Configuring the Natural Language Search Threshold
* Modifying Boolean Full-Text Search Operators
* Character Set Modifications
* Rebuilding InnoDB Full-Text Indexes
* Optimizing InnoDB Full-Text Indexes
* Rebuilding MyISAM Full-Text Indexes

#### Configuring Minimum and Maximum Word Length

The minimum and maximum lengths of words to be indexed are defined by the `innodb_ft_min_token_size` and `innodb_ft_max_token_size` for `InnoDB` search indexes, and `ft_min_word_len` and `ft_max_word_len` for `MyISAM` ones.

Note

Minimum and maximum word length full-text parameters do not apply to `FULLTEXT` indexes created using the ngram parser. ngram token size is defined by the `ngram_token_size` option.

After changing any of these options, rebuild your `FULLTEXT` indexes for the change to take effect. For example, to make two-character words searchable, you could put the following lines in an option file:

```
[mysqld]
innodb_ft_min_token_size=2
ft_min_word_len=2
```

Then restart the server and rebuild your `FULLTEXT` indexes. For `MyISAM` tables, note the remarks regarding **myisamchk** in the instructions that follow for rebuilding `MyISAM` full-text indexes.

#### Configuring the Natural Language Search Threshold

For `MyISAM` search indexes, the 50% threshold for natural language searches is determined by the particular weighting scheme chosen. To disable it, look for the following line in `storage/myisam/ftdefs.h`:

```
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_PROB
```

Change that line to this:

```
#define GWS_IN_USE GWS_FREQ
```

Then recompile MySQL. There is no need to rebuild the indexes in this case.

Note

By making this change, you *severely* decrease MySQL's ability to provide adequate relevance values for the `MATCH()` function. If you really need to search for such common words, it would be better to search using `IN BOOLEAN MODE` instead, which does not observe the 50% threshold.

#### Modifying Boolean Full-Text Search Operators

To change the operators used for boolean full-text searches on `MyISAM` tables, set the `ft_boolean_syntax` system variable. (`InnoDB` does not have an equivalent setting.) This variable can be changed while the server is running, but you must have privileges sufficient to set global system variables (see Section 7.1.9.1, “System Variable Privileges”). No rebuilding of indexes is necessary in this case.

#### Character Set Modifications

For the built-in full-text parser, you can change the set of characters that are considered word characters in several ways, as described in the following list. After making the modification, rebuild the indexes for each table that contains any `FULLTEXT` indexes. Suppose that you want to treat the hyphen character ('-') as a word character. Use one of these methods:

* Modify the MySQL source: In `storage/innobase/handler/ha_innodb.cc` (for `InnoDB`), or in `storage/myisam/ftdefs.h` (for `MyISAM`), see the `true_word_char()` and `misc_word_char()` macros. Add `'-'` to one of those macros and recompile MySQL.

* Modify a character set file: This requires no recompilation. The `true_word_char()` macro uses a “character type” table to distinguish letters and numbers from other characters. . You can edit the contents of the `<ctype><map>` array in one of the character set XML files to specify that `'-'` is a “letter.” Then use the given character set for your `FULLTEXT` indexes. For information about the `<ctype><map>` array format, see Section 12.13.1, “Character Definition Arrays”.

* Add a new collation for the character set used by the indexed columns, and alter the columns to use that collation. For general information about adding collations, see Section 12.14, “Adding a Collation to a Character Set”. For an example specific to full-text indexing, see Section 14.9.7, “Adding a User-Defined Collation for Full-Text Indexing”.

#### Rebuilding InnoDB Full-Text Indexes

For the changes to take effect, `FULLTEXT` indexes must be rebuilt after modifying any of the following full-text index variables: `innodb_ft_min_token_size`; `innodb_ft_max_token_size`; `innodb_ft_server_stopword_table`; `innodb_ft_user_stopword_table`; `innodb_ft_enable_stopword`; `ngram_token_size`. Modifying `innodb_ft_min_token_size`, `innodb_ft_max_token_size`, or `ngram_token_size` requires restarting the server.

To rebuild `FULLTEXT` indexes for an `InnoDB` table, use `ALTER TABLE` with the `DROP INDEX` and `ADD INDEX` options to drop and re-create each index.

#### Optimizing InnoDB Full-Text Indexes

Running `OPTIMIZE TABLE` on a table with a full-text index rebuilds the full-text index, removing deleted Document IDs and consolidating multiple entries for the same word, where possible.

To optimize a full-text index, enable `innodb_optimize_fulltext_only` and run `OPTIMIZE TABLE`.

```
mysql> set GLOBAL innodb_optimize_fulltext_only=ON;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> OPTIMIZE TABLE opening_lines;
+--------------------+----------+----------+----------+
| Table              | Op       | Msg_type | Msg_text |
+--------------------+----------+----------+----------+
| test.opening_lines | optimize | status   | OK       |
+--------------------+----------+----------+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

To avoid lengthy rebuild times for full-text indexes on large tables, you can use the `innodb_ft_num_word_optimize` option to perform the optimization in stages. The `innodb_ft_num_word_optimize` option defines the number of words that are optimized each time `OPTIMIZE TABLE` is run. The default setting is 2000, which means that 2000 words are optimized each time [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](optimize-table.html "15.7.3.4 OPTIMIZE TABLE Statement") is run. Subsequent `OPTIMIZE TABLE` operations continue from where the preceding `OPTIMIZE TABLE` operation ended.

#### Rebuilding MyISAM Full-Text Indexes

If you modify full-text variables that affect indexing (`ft_min_word_len`, `ft_max_word_len`, or `ft_stopword_file`), or if you change the stopword file itself, you must rebuild your `FULLTEXT` indexes after making the changes and restarting the server.

To rebuild the `FULLTEXT` indexes for a `MyISAM` table, it is sufficient to do a `QUICK` repair operation:

```
mysql> REPAIR TABLE tbl_name QUICK;
```

Alternatively, use `ALTER TABLE` as just described. In some cases, this may be faster than a repair operation.

Each table that contains any `FULLTEXT` index must be repaired as just shown. Otherwise, queries for the table may yield incorrect results, and modifications to the table causes the server to see the table as corrupt and in need of repair.

If you use **myisamchk** to perform an operation that modifies `MyISAM`  table indexes (such as repair or analyze), the `FULLTEXT` indexes are rebuilt using the *default* full-text parameter values for minimum word length, maximum word length, and stopword file unless you specify otherwise. This can result in queries failing.

The problem occurs because these parameters are known only by the server. They are not stored in `MyISAM` index files. To avoid the problem if you have modified the minimum or maximum word length or stopword file values used by the server, specify the same `ft_min_word_len`, `ft_max_word_len`, and `ft_stopword_file` values for **myisamchk** that you use for **mysqld**. For example, if you have set the minimum word length to 3, you can repair a table with **myisamchk** like this:

```
myisamchk --recover --ft_min_word_len=3 tbl_name.MYI
```

To ensure that **myisamchk** and the server use the same values for full-text parameters, place each one in both the `[mysqld]` and `[myisamchk]` sections of an option file:

```
[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len=3

[myisamchk]
ft_min_word_len=3
```

An alternative to using **myisamchk** for `MyISAM` table index modification is to use the `REPAIR TABLE`, `ANALYZE TABLE`, `OPTIMIZE TABLE`, or `ALTER TABLE` statements. These statements are performed by the server, which knows the proper full-text parameter values to use.


### 14.9.7 Adding a User-Defined Collation for Full-Text Indexing

Warning

User-defined collations are deprecated; you should expect support for them to be removed in a future version of MySQL. The server issues a warning for any use of `COLLATE user_defined_collation` in an SQL statement; a warning is also issued when the server is started with `--collation-server` set equal to the name of a user-defined collation.

This section describes how to add a user-defined collation for full-text searches using the built-in full-text parser. The sample collation is like `latin1_swedish_ci` but treats the `'-'` character as a letter rather than as a punctuation character so that it can be indexed as a word character. General information about adding collations is given in Section 12.14, “Adding a Collation to a Character Set”; it is assumed that you have read it and are familiar with the files involved.

To add a collation for full-text indexing, use the following procedure. The instructions here add a collation for a simple character set, which as discussed in Section 12.14, “Adding a Collation to a Character Set”, can be created using a configuration file that describes the character set properties. For a complex character set such as Unicode, create collations using C source files that describe the character set properties.

1. Add a collation to the `Index.xml` file. The permitted range of IDs for user-defined collations is given in Section 12.14.2, “Choosing a Collation ID”. The ID must be unused, so choose a value different from 1025 if that ID is already taken on your system.

   ```
   <charset name="latin1">
   ...
   <collation name="latin1_fulltext_ci" id="1025"/>
   </charset>
   ```

2. Declare the sort order for the collation in the `latin1.xml` file. In this case, the order can be copied from `latin1_swedish_ci`:

   ```
   <collation name="latin1_fulltext_ci">
   <map>
   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
   10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F
   20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F
   30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F
   40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 4A 4B 4C 4D 4E 4F
   50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 5A 5B 5C 5D 5E 5F
   60 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 4A 4B 4C 4D 4E 4F
   50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 5A 7B 7C 7D 7E 7F
   80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 8A 8B 8C 8D 8E 8F
   90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 9A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9F
   A0 A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 AA AB AC AD AE AF
   B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 BA BB BC BD BE BF
   41 41 41 41 5C 5B 5C 43 45 45 45 45 49 49 49 49
   44 4E 4F 4F 4F 4F 5D D7 D8 55 55 55 59 59 DE DF
   41 41 41 41 5C 5B 5C 43 45 45 45 45 49 49 49 49
   44 4E 4F 4F 4F 4F 5D F7 D8 55 55 55 59 59 DE FF
   </map>
   </collation>
   ```

3. Modify the `ctype` array in `latin1.xml`. Change the value corresponding to 0x2D (which is the code for the `'-'` character) from 10 (punctuation) to 01 (uppercase letter). In the following array, this is the element in the fourth row down, third value from the end.

   ```
   <ctype>
   <map>
   00
   20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 28 28 28 28 28 20 20
   20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
   48 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 01 10 10
   84 84 84 84 84 84 84 84 84 84 10 10 10 10 10 10
   10 81 81 81 81 81 81 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01
   01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 10 10 10 10 10
   10 82 82 82 82 82 82 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02
   02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 10 10 10 10 20
   10 00 10 02 10 10 10 10 10 10 01 10 01 00 01 00
   00 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 02 10 02 00 02 01
   48 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
   10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
   01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01
   01 01 01 01 01 01 01 10 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 02
   02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02
   02 02 02 02 02 02 02 10 02 02 02 02 02 02 02 02
   </map>
   </ctype>
   ```

4. Restart the server.
5. To employ the new collation, include it in the definition of columns that are to use it:

   ```
   mysql> DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.13 sec)

   mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 (
       a TEXT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_fulltext_ci,
       FULLTEXT INDEX(a)
       ) ENGINE=InnoDB;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.47 sec)
   ```

6. Test the collation to verify that hyphen is considered as a word character:

   ```
   mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUEs ('----'),('....'),('abcd');
   Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.22 sec)
   Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

   mysql> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE MATCH a AGAINST ('----' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
   +------+
   | a    |
   +------+
   | ---- |
   +------+
   1 row in set (0.00 sec)
   ```


### 14.9.8 ngram Full-Text Parser

The built-in MySQL full-text parser uses the white space between words as a delimiter to determine where words begin and end, which is a limitation when working with ideographic languages that do not use word delimiters. To address this limitation, MySQL provides an ngram full-text parser that supports Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK). The ngram full-text parser is supported for use with `InnoDB` and `MyISAM`.

Note

MySQL also provides a MeCab full-text parser plugin for Japanese, which tokenizes documents into meaningful words. For more information, see Section 14.9.9, “MeCab Full-Text Parser Plugin”.

An ngram is a contiguous sequence of *`n`* characters from a given sequence of text. The ngram parser tokenizes a sequence of text into a contiguous sequence of *`n`* characters. For example, you can tokenize “abcd” for different values of *`n`* using the ngram full-text parser.

```
n=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'
n=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'
n=3: 'abc', 'bcd'
n=4: 'abcd'
```

The ngram full-text parser is a built-in server plugin. As with other built-in server plugins, it is automatically loaded when the server is started.

The full-text search syntax described in Section 14.9, “Full-Text Search Functions” applies to the ngram parser plugin. Differences in parsing behavior are described in this section. Full-text-related configuration options, except for minimum and maximum word length options (`innodb_ft_min_token_size`, `innodb_ft_max_token_size`, `ft_min_word_len`, `ft_max_word_len`) are also applicable.

#### Configuring ngram Token Size

The ngram parser has a default ngram token size of 2 (bigram). For example, with a token size of 2, the ngram parser parses the string “abc def” into four tokens: “ab”, “bc”, “de” and “ef”.

ngram token size is configurable using the `ngram_token_size` configuration option, which has a minimum value of 1 and maximum value of 10.

Typically, `ngram_token_size` is set to the size of the largest token that you want to search for. If you only intend to search for single characters, set `ngram_token_size` to 1. A smaller token size produces a smaller full-text search index, and faster searches. If you need to search for words comprised of more than one character, set `ngram_token_size` accordingly. For example, “Happy Birthday” is “生日快乐” in simplified Chinese, where “生日” is “birthday”, and “快乐” translates as “happy”. To search on two-character words such as these, set `ngram_token_size` to a value of 2 or higher.

As a read-only variable, `ngram_token_size` may only be set as part of a startup string or in a configuration file:

* Startup string:

  ```
  mysqld --ngram_token_size=2
  ```

* Configuration file:

  ```
  [mysqld]
  ngram_token_size=2
  ```

Note

The following minimum and maximum word length configuration options are ignored for `FULLTEXT` indexes that use the ngram parser: `innodb_ft_min_token_size`, `innodb_ft_max_token_size`, `ft_min_word_len`, and `ft_max_word_len`.

#### Creating a FULLTEXT Index that Uses the ngram Parser

To create a `FULLTEXT` index that uses the ngram parser, specify `WITH PARSER ngram` with `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, or `CREATE INDEX`.

The following example demonstrates creating a table with an `ngram` `FULLTEXT` index, inserting sample data (Simplified Chinese text), and viewing tokenized data in the Information Schema `INNODB_FT_INDEX_CACHE` table.

```
mysql> USE test;

mysql> CREATE TABLE articles (
      id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      title VARCHAR(200),
      body TEXT,
      FULLTEXT (title,body) WITH PARSER ngram
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;

mysql> SET NAMES utf8mb4;

INSERT INTO articles (title,body) VALUES
    ('数据库管理','在本教程中我将向你展示如何管理数据库'),
    ('数据库应用开发','学习开发数据库应用程序');

mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_ft_aux_table="test/articles";

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_INDEX_CACHE ORDER BY doc_id, position;
```

To add a `FULLTEXT` index to an existing table, you can use `ALTER TABLE` or `CREATE INDEX`. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE articles (
      id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      title VARCHAR(200),
      body TEXT
     ) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;

ALTER TABLE articles ADD FULLTEXT INDEX ft_index (title,body) WITH PARSER ngram;

# Or:

CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ft_index ON articles (title,body) WITH PARSER ngram;
```

#### ngram Parser Space Handling

The ngram parser eliminates spaces when parsing. For example:

* “ab cd” is parsed to “ab”, “cd”

* “a bc” is parsed to “bc”

#### ngram Parser Stopword Handling

The built-in MySQL full-text parser compares words to entries in the stopword list. If a word is equal to an entry in the stopword list, the word is excluded from the index. For the ngram parser, stopword handling is performed differently. Instead of excluding tokens that are equal to entries in the stopword list, the ngram parser excludes tokens that *contain* stopwords. For example, assuming `ngram_token_size=2`, a document that contains “a,b” is parsed to “a,” and “,b”. If a comma (“,”) is defined as a stopword, both “a,” and “,b” are excluded from the index because they contain a comma.

By default, the ngram parser uses the default stopword list, which contains a list of English stopwords. For a stopword list applicable to Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, you must create your own. For information about creating a stopword list, see Section 14.9.4, “Full-Text Stopwords”.

Stopwords greater in length than `ngram_token_size` are ignored.

#### ngram Parser Term Search

For *natural language mode* search, the search term is converted to a union of ngram terms. For example, the string “abc” (assuming `ngram_token_size=2`) is converted to “ab bc”. Given two documents, one containing “ab” and the other containing “abc”, the search term “ab bc” matches both documents.

For *boolean mode search*, the search term is converted to an ngram phrase search. For example, the string 'abc' (assuming `ngram_token_size=2`) is converted to '“ab bc”'. Given two documents, one containing 'ab' and the other containing 'abc', the search phrase '“ab bc”' only matches the document containing 'abc'.

#### ngram Parser Wildcard Search

Because an ngram `FULLTEXT` index contains only ngrams, and does not contain information about the beginning of terms, wildcard searches may return unexpected results. The following behaviors apply to wildcard searches using ngram `FULLTEXT` search indexes:

* If the prefix term of a wildcard search is shorter than ngram token size, the query returns all indexed rows that contain ngram tokens starting with the prefix term. For example, assuming `ngram_token_size=2`, a search on “a\*” returns all rows starting with “a”.

* If the prefix term of a wildcard search is longer than ngram token size, the prefix term is converted to an ngram phrase and the wildcard operator is ignored. For example, assuming `ngram_token_size=2`, an “abc\*” wildcard search is converted to “ab bc”.

#### ngram Parser Phrase Search

Phrase searches are converted to ngram phrase searches. For example, The search phrase “abc” is converted to “ab bc”, which returns documents containing “abc” and “ab bc”.

The search phrase “abc def” is converted to “ab bc de ef”, which returns documents containing “abc def” and “ab bc de ef”. A document that contains “abcdef” is not returned.


### 14.9.9 MeCab Full-Text Parser Plugin

The built-in MySQL full-text parser uses the white space between words as a delimiter to determine where words begin and end, which is a limitation when working with ideographic languages that do not use word delimiters. To address this limitation for Japanese, MySQL provides a MeCab full-text parser plugin. The MeCab full-text parser plugin is supported for use with `InnoDB` and `MyISAM`.

Note

MySQL also provides an ngram full-text parser plugin that supports Japanese. For more information, see Section 14.9.8, “ngram Full-Text Parser”.

The MeCab full-text parser plugin is a full-text parser plugin for Japanese that tokenizes a sequence of text into meaningful words. For example, MeCab tokenizes “データベース管理” (“Database Management”) into “データベース” (“Database”) and “管理” (“Management”). By comparison, the ngram full-text parser tokenizes text into a contiguous sequence of *`n`* characters, where *`n`* represents a number between 1 and 10.

In addition to tokenizing text into meaningful words, MeCab indexes are typically smaller than ngram indexes, and MeCab full-text searches are generally faster. One drawback is that it may take longer for the MeCab full-text parser to tokenize documents, compared to the ngram full-text parser.

The full-text search syntax described in Section 14.9, “Full-Text Search Functions” applies to the MeCab parser plugin. Differences in parsing behavior are described in this section. Full-text related configuration options are also applicable.

For additional information about the MeCab parser, refer to the [MeCab: Yet Another Part-of-Speech and Morphological Analyzer](http://taku910.github.io/mecab/) project on Github.

#### Installing the MeCab Parser Plugin

The MeCab parser plugin requires `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic`.

On supported Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu platforms (except Ubuntu 12.04 where the system `mecab` version is too old), MySQL dynamically links to the system `mecab` installation if it is installed to the default location. On other supported Unix-like platforms, `libmecab.so` is statically linked in `libpluginmecab.so`, which is located in the MySQL plugin directory. `mecab-ipadic` is included in MySQL binaries and is located in `MYSQL_HOME\lib\mecab`.

You can install `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic` using a native package management utility (on Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu), or you can build `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic` from source. For information about installing `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic` using a native package management utility, see [Installing MeCab From a Binary Distribution (Optional)](fulltext-search-mecab.html#install-mecab-binary "Installing MeCab From a Binary Distribution (Optional)"). If you want to build `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic` from source, see [Building MeCab From Source (Optional)](fulltext-search-mecab.html#build-mecab-from-source "Installing MeCab From Source (Optional)").

On Windows, `libmecab.dll` is found in the MySQL `bin` directory. `mecab-ipadic` is located in `MYSQL_HOME/lib/mecab`.

To install and configure the MeCab parser plugin, perform the following steps:

1. In the MySQL configuration file, set the `mecab_rc_file` configuration option to the location of the `mecabrc` configuration file, which is the configuration file for MeCab. If you are using the MeCab package distributed with MySQL, the `mecabrc` file is located in `MYSQL_HOME/lib/mecab/etc/`.

   ```
   [mysqld]
   loose-mecab-rc-file=MYSQL_HOME/lib/mecab/etc/mecabrc
   ```

   The `loose` prefix is an option modifier. The `mecab_rc_file` option is not recognized by MySQL until the MeCaB parser plugin is installed but it must be set before attempting to install the MeCaB parser plugin. The `loose` prefix allows you restart MySQL without encountering an error due to an unrecognized variable.

   If you use your own MeCab installation, or build MeCab from source, the location of the `mecabrc` configuration file may differ.

   For information about the MySQL configuration file and its location, see Section 6.2.2.2, “Using Option Files”.

2. Also in the MySQL configuration file, set the minimum token size to 1 or 2, which are the values recommended for use with the MeCab parser. For `InnoDB` tables, minimum token size is defined by the `innodb_ft_min_token_size` configuration option, which has a default value of 3. For `MyISAM` tables, minimum token size is defined by `ft_min_word_len`, which has a default value of 4.

   ```
   [mysqld]
   innodb_ft_min_token_size=1
   ```

3. Modify the `mecabrc` configuration file to specify the dictionary you want to use. The `mecab-ipadic` package distributed with MySQL binaries includes three dictionaries (`ipadic_euc-jp`, `ipadic_sjis`, and `ipadic_utf-8`). The `mecabrc` configuration file packaged with MySQL contains and entry similar to the following:

   ```
   dicdir =  /path/to/mysql/lib/mecab/lib/mecab/dic/ipadic_euc-jp
   ```

   To use the `ipadic_utf-8` dictionary, for example, modify the entry as follows:

   ```
   dicdir=MYSQL_HOME/lib/mecab/dic/ipadic_utf-8
   ```

   If you are using your own MeCab installation or have built MeCab from source, the default `dicdir` entry in the `mecabrc` file is likely to differ, as are the dictionaries and their location.

   Note

   After the MeCab parser plugin is installed, you can use the `mecab_charset` status variable to view the character set used with MeCab. The three MeCab dictionaries provided with the MySQL binary support the following character sets.

   * The `ipadic_euc-jp` dictionary supports the `ujis` and `eucjpms` character sets.

   * The `ipadic_sjis` dictionary supports the `sjis` and `cp932` character sets.

   * The `ipadic_utf-8` dictionary supports the `utf8mb3` and `utf8mb4` character sets.

   `mecab_charset` only reports the first supported character set. For example, the `ipadic_utf-8` dictionary supports both `utf8mb3` and `utf8mb4`. `mecab_charset` always reports `utf8` when this dictionary is in use.

4. Restart MySQL.
5. Install the MeCab parser plugin:

   The MeCab parser plugin is installed using `INSTALL PLUGIN`. The plugin name is `mecab`, and the shared library name is `libpluginmecab.so`. For additional information about installing plugins, see Section 7.6.1, “Installing and Uninstalling Plugins”.

   ```
   INSTALL PLUGIN mecab SONAME 'libpluginmecab.so';
   ```

   Once installed, the MeCab parser plugin loads at every normal MySQL restart.

6. Verify that the MeCab parser plugin is loaded using the `SHOW PLUGINS` statement.

   ```
   mysql> SHOW PLUGINS;
   ```

   A `mecab` plugin should appear in the list of plugins.

#### Creating a FULLTEXT Index that uses the MeCab Parser

To create a `FULLTEXT` index that uses the mecab parser, specify `WITH PARSER ngram` with `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, or `CREATE INDEX`.

This example demonstrates creating a table with a `mecab` `FULLTEXT` index, inserting sample data, and viewing tokenized data in the Information Schema `INNODB_FT_INDEX_CACHE` table:

```
mysql> USE test;

mysql> CREATE TABLE articles (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200),
    body TEXT,
    FULLTEXT (title,body) WITH PARSER mecab
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;

mysql> SET NAMES utf8mb4;

mysql> INSERT INTO articles (title,body) VALUES
    ('データベース管理','このチュートリアルでは、私はどのようにデータベースを管理する方法を紹介します'),
    ('データベースアプリケーション開発','データベースアプリケーションを開発することを学ぶ');

mysql> SET GLOBAL innodb_ft_aux_table="test/articles";

mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_FT_INDEX_CACHE ORDER BY doc_id, position;
```

To add a `FULLTEXT` index to an existing table, you can use `ALTER TABLE` or `CREATE INDEX`. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(200),
    body TEXT
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;

ALTER TABLE articles ADD FULLTEXT INDEX ft_index (title,body) WITH PARSER mecab;

# Or:

CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ft_index ON articles (title,body) WITH PARSER mecab;
```

#### MeCab Parser Space Handling

The MeCab parser uses spaces as separators in query strings. For example, the MeCab parser tokenizes データベース管理 as データベース and 管理.

#### MeCab Parser Stopword Handling

By default, the MeCab parser uses the default stopword list, which contains a short list of English stopwords. For a stopword list applicable to Japanese, you must create your own. For information about creating stopword lists, see Section 14.9.4, “Full-Text Stopwords”.

#### MeCab Parser Term Search

For natural language mode search, the search term is converted to a union of tokens. For example, データベース管理 is converted to データベース 管理.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles
    WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST('データベース管理' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```

For boolean mode search, the search term is converted to a search phrase. For example, データベース管理 is converted to データベース 管理.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles
    WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST('データベース管理' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

#### MeCab Parser Wildcard Search

Wildcard search terms are not tokenized. A search on データベース管理\* is performed on the prefix, データベース管理.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles
    WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST('データベース*' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

#### MeCab Parser Phrase Search

Phrases are tokenized. For example, データベース管理 is tokenized as データベース 管理.

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM articles
    WHERE MATCH(title,body) AGAINST('"データベース管理"' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

#### Installing MeCab From a Binary Distribution (Optional)

This section describes how to install `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic` from a binary distribution using a native package management utility. For example, on Fedora, you can use Yum to perform the installation:

```
$> yum mecab-devel
```

On Debian or Ubuntu, you can perform an APT installation:

```
$> apt-get install mecab
$> apt-get install mecab-ipadic
```

#### Installing MeCab From Source (Optional)

If you want to build `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic` from source, basic installation steps are provided below. For additional information, refer to the MeCab documentation.

1. Download the tar.gz packages for `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic` from <http://taku910.github.io/mecab/#download>. As of February, 2016, the latest available packages are `mecab-0.996.tar.gz` and `mecab-ipadic-2.7.0-20070801.tar.gz`.

2. Install `mecab`:

   ```
   $> tar zxfv mecab-0.996.tar
   $> cd mecab-0.996
   $> ./configure
   $> make
   $> make check
   $> su
   $> make install
   ```

3. Install `mecab-ipadic`:

   ```
   $> tar zxfv mecab-ipadic-2.7.0-20070801.tar
   $> cd mecab-ipadic-2.7.0-20070801
   $> ./configure
   $> make
   $> su
   $> make install
   ```

4. Compile MySQL using the `WITH_MECAB` CMake option. Set the `WITH_MECAB` option to `system` if you have installed `mecab` and `mecab-ipadic` to the default location.

   ```
   -DWITH_MECAB=system
   ```

   If you defined a custom installation directory, set `WITH_MECAB` to the custom directory. For example:

   ```
   -DWITH_MECAB=/path/to/mecab
   ```
