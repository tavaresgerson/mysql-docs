MySQL Enterprise Edition includes a set of encryption functions that expose OpenSSL capabilities at the SQL level. The functions enable Enterprise applications to perform the following operations:

* Implement added data protection using public-key asymmetric cryptography

* Create public and private keys and digital signatures
* Perform asymmetric encryption and decryption
* Use cryptographic hashing for digital signing and data verification and validation

These functions are provided by the MySQL `component_enterprise_encryption` component.
