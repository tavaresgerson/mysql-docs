#### 19.4.9.1 Asynchronous Connection Failover for Sources

To activate asynchronous connection failover for a replication channel set `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER=1` in a `CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO` statement for this channel. GTID auto-positioning must be in use for the channel (`SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION = 1`).

Important

When the existing connection to a source fails, the replica first retries the same connection the number of times specified by the `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` option of the `CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO`. The interval between attempts is set by the `SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY` option. When these attempts are exhausted, the asynchronous connection failover mechanism takes over. Note that the defaults for these options, which were designed for a connection to a single source, make the replica retry the same connection for 60 days. To ensure that the asynchronous connection failover mechanism can be activated promptly, set `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT` and `SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY` to minimal numbers that just allow a few retry attempts with the same source, in case the connection failure is caused by a transient network outage. Suitable values are `SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT=3` and `SOURCE_CONNECT_RETRY=10`, which make the replica retry the connection 3 times with 10-second intervals between.

You also need to set the source list for the replication channel, to specify the sources that are available for failover. You set and manage source lists using the `asynchronous_connection_failover_add_source` and `asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_source` functions to add and remove single replication source servers. To add and remove managed groups of servers, use the `asynchronous_connection_failover_add_managed` and `asynchronous_connection_failover_delete_managed` functions instead.

The functions name the relevant replication channel and specify the host name, port number, network namespace, and weighted priority (1-100, with 100 being the highest priority) of a MySQL instance to add to or delete from the channel's source list. For a managed group, you also specify the type of managed service (currently only Group Replication is available), and the identifier of the managed group (for Group Replication, this is the value of the `group_replication_group_name` system variable). When you add a managed group, you only need to add one group member, and the replica automatically adds the rest from the current group membership. When you delete a managed group, you delete the entire group together.

The asynchronous connection failover mechanism also fails over the connection if another available server on the source list has a higher priority (weight) setting. This feature ensures that the replica stays connected to the most suitable source server at all times, and it applies to both managed groups and single (non-managed) servers. For a managed group, a source’s weight is assigned depending on whether it is a primary or a secondary server. So assuming that you set up the managed group to give a higher weight to a primary and a lower weight to a secondary, when the primary changes, the higher weight is assigned to the new primary, so the replica changes over the connection to it. The asynchronous connection failover mechanism additionally changes connection if the currently connected managed source server leaves the managed group, or is no longer in the majority in the managed group.

When failing over a connection, the source with the highest priority (weight) setting among the alternative sources listed in the source list for the channel is chosen for the first connection attempt. The replica checks first that it can connect to the source server, or in the case of a managed group, that the source server has `ONLINE` status in the group (not `RECOVERING` or unavailable). If the highest weighted source is not available, the replica tries with all the listed sources in descending order of weight, then starts again from the highest weighted source. If multiple sources have the same weight, the replica orders them randomly. If the replica needs to start working through the list again, it includes and retries the source to which the original connection failure occurred.

The source lists are stored in the `mysql.replication_asynchronous_connection_failover` and `mysql.replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed` tables, and can be viewed in the Performance Schema `replication_asynchronous_connection_failover` and `replication_asynchronous_connection_failover_managed` tables. The replica uses a monitor thread to track the membership of managed groups and update the source list (`thread/sql/replica_monitor`). The setting for the `SOURCE_CONNECTION_AUTO_FAILOVER` option of the `CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO` statement, and the source list, are transferred to a clone of the replica during a remote cloning operation.
