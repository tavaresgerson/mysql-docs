#### 27.3.6.3 SqlResult Object

An `SqlResult` is produced whenever a query is executed using `sqlExecute.execute()`, `PreparedStatement.execute()`, or `Session.runSql()`.

Note

No `SqlResult` is produced if `passResultsToClient` is used.

Methods supported by `SqlResult` are listed here:

* `close()`: Closes the result set. The value returned is undefined.

* `fetchAll()`: Retrieves a list of all rows in the result set.

* `fetchOne()`: Retrieves the next `Row` in the result set.

* `getAffectedItemsCount()`: Retrieves the number of rows affected by the most recent operation.

* `getAutoIncrementValue()`: Retrieves the autogenerated ID used for the most recent insert operation.

  Calling this method is equivalent to executing `LAST_INSERT_ID()` in the **mysql** client.

* `getColumnCount()`: Gets the number of columns in the result set.

* `getColumnNames()`: Retrieves the names of the columns in the current result set.

* `getColumns()`: Retrieves the columns metadata in the current result set.

* `getExecutionTime()`: Retrieves the time spent executing this query, to the nearest whole second.

* `getWarnings()`: Retrieves any warnings (as a list of `Warning` objects) raised by the operation most recently executed.

* `getWarningsCount()`: Retrieves the number of warnings raised by the operation last executed.

* `hasData()`: Returns `true` if the most recently executed statement yielded a result set, `false` otherwise.

* `nextResult()`: Moves to the next result set if available. Returns `true` if the result set is available and contains data.
