## 7.2 The MySQL Data Directory

Information managed by the MySQL server is stored under a directory known as the data directory. The following list briefly describes the items typically found in the data directory, with cross references for additional information:

* Data directory subdirectories. Each subdirectory of the data directory is a database directory and corresponds to a database managed by the server. All MySQL installations have certain standard databases:

  + The `mysql` directory corresponds to the `mysql` system schema, which contains information required by the MySQL server as it runs. This database contains data dictionary tables and system tables. See Section 7.3, “The mysql System Schema”.

  + The `performance_schema` directory corresponds to the Performance Schema, which provides information used to inspect the internal execution of the server at runtime. See Chapter 29, *MySQL Performance Schema*.

  + The `sys` directory corresponds to the `sys` schema, which provides a set of objects to help interpret Performance Schema information more easily. See Chapter 30, *MySQL sys Schema*.

  + The `ndbinfo` directory corresponds to the `ndbinfo` database that stores information specific to NDB Cluster (present only for installations built to include NDB Cluster). See Section 25.6.15, “ndbinfo: The NDB Cluster Information Database”.

  Other subdirectories correspond to databases created by users or applications.

  Note

  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is a standard database, but its implementation uses no corresponding database directory.

* Log files written by the server. See Section 7.4, “MySQL Server Logs”.

* `InnoDB` tablespace and log files. See Chapter 17, *The InnoDB Storage Engine*.

* Default/autogenerated SSL and RSA certificate and key files. See Section 8.3.3, “Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys”.

* The server process ID file (while the server is running).
* The `mysqld-auto.cnf` file that stores persisted global system variable settings. See Section 15.7.6.1, “SET Syntax for Variable Assignment”.

Some items in the preceding list can be relocated elsewhere by reconfiguring the server. In addition, the `--datadir` option enables the location of the data directory itself to be changed. For a given MySQL installation, check the server configuration to determine whether items have been moved.
