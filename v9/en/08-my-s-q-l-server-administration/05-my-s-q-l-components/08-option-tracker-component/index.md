The Option Tracker component provides information about features of the MySQL server, as well as about MySQL components and plugins that are installed on the system:

* Purpose: Provide information about MySQL features. These may be integral to the MySQL server, and may also be implemented by components or plugins installed on the system.

* URN: `file://component_option_tracker`

Note

In this context, we refer to these features as “options”. These should not be confused with command-line options used with MySQL programs such as **mysqld** or the **mysql** client.

This component is available as part of MySQL Enterprise Edition, a commercial offering.

See Section 7.5.8.2, “Option Tracker Supported Components”, for information about the features and components which support the Option Tracker.
