These distributed algorithms and protocols include global checkpointing, DDL (schema) changes, and node restart handling. To make this coordination simpler, the data nodes <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">elect</span>”</span> one of their number to act as leader. There is no user-facing mechanism for influencing this selection, which is completely automatic; the fact that it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> automatic is a key part of NDB Cluster's internal architecture. </p><p> When a node acts as the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">leader</span>”</span> for any of these mechanisms, it is usually the point of coordination for the activity, and the other nodes act as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">followers</span>”</span>, carrying out their parts of the activity as directed by the leader. If the node acting as leader fails, then the remaining nodes elect a new leader. Tasks in progress that were being coordinated by the old leader may either fail or be continued by the new leader, depending on the actual mechanism involved. </p><p> It is possible for some of these different mechanisms and protocols to have different leader nodes, but in general the same leader is chosen for all of them. The node indicated as the leader in the output of <a class="link" href="mysql-cluster-mgm-client-commands.html#ndbclient-show"><code class="literal">SHOW</code></a> in the management client is known internally as the <a class="ulink" href="/doc/ndb-internals/en/ndb-internals-kernel-blocks-dbdict.html" target="_top"><code class="literal">DICT</code></a> manager, responsible for coordinating DDL and metadata activity. </p><p> NDB Cluster is designed in such a way that the choice of leader has no discernible effect outside the cluster itself. For example, the current leader does not have significantly higher CPU or resource usage than the other data nodes, and failure of the leader should not have a significantly different impact on the cluster than the failure of any other data node. </p></td></tr><tr class="question"><td align="left" valign="top"><a name="faq-cluster-which-os-clustering"></a><a name="id469415"></a><p><b>A.10.8.</b></p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p> With which operating systems can I use NDB Cluster? </p></td></tr><tr class="answer"><td align="left" valign="top"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p> NDB Cluster is supported on most Unix-like operating systems.

For data nodes and API nodes, faster CPUs and more memory are likely to improve performance, and 64-bit CPUs are likely to be more effective than 32-bit processors.

This is due to the fact that less memory is required (because no ordered indexes are created), and that less CPU must be utilized (because fewer indexes must be read and possibly updated). However, it also means that queries that could otherwise use range scans must be satisfied by other means, which can result in slower selects. </p><p> When calculating Cluster memory requirements, you may find useful the <a class="link" href="mysql-cluster-programs-ndb-size-pl.html" title="25.5.29 ndb_size.pl — NDBCLUSTER Size Requirement Estimator"><span><strong>ndb_size.pl</strong></span></a> utility which is available in recent MySQL 9.5 releases.

Where available, SHM is used by default between nodes residing on the same cluster host; however, this is considered experimental. SCI is a high-speed (1 gigabit per second and higher), high-availability protocol used in building scalable multi-processor systems; it requires special hardware and drivers.

In fact, it is possible that two sets of data nodes might become isolated from one another in a network partitioning, also known as a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">split-brain</span>”</span> scenario. This type of situation is undesirable because each set of data nodes tries to behave as though it is the entire cluster. An arbitrator is required to decide between the competing sets of data nodes. </p><p> When all data nodes in at least one node group are alive, network partitioning is not an issue, because no single subset of the cluster can form a functional cluster on its own. The real problem arises when no single node group has all its nodes alive, in which case network partitioning (the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">split-brain</span>”</span> scenario) becomes possible. Then an arbitrator is required. All cluster nodes recognize the same node as the arbitrator, which is normally the management server; however, it is possible to configure any of the MySQL Servers in the cluster to act as the arbitrator instead. The arbitrator accepts the first set of cluster nodes to contact it, and tells the remaining set to shut down. Arbitrator selection is controlled by the <code class="literal">ArbitrationRank</code> configuration parameter for MySQL Server and management server nodes. You can also use the <code class="literal">ArbitrationRank</code> configuration parameter to control the arbitrator selection process.
